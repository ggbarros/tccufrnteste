	abstract = {Given the complex operational environment of offshore platforms, accurate identification of structural damage has become a crucial aspect of structural health monitoring. However, accurately pinpointing the damage locations based on vibration data under load, particularly for intricate platform structures, is a challenging task. Existing damage-identification methods, particularly those rooted in deep learning frameworks, often encounter difficulties when applied to marine platforms. Therefore, this study proposes an innovative approach. The accuracy of damage identification for marine platforms operating under unique service conditions was enhanced by introducing a deconvolutional parallel processing module and an auxiliary loss function processing module into the core ResNet50 network. This enhancement improved the accuracy of the model in detecting damage within complex marine structures. Information processing is enriched by fusing the vibration data acquired from the measurement points across different domains: time, frequency, and recurrence plots. The results of this approach were remarkable. When the algorithm model, validated through model experiments, is extended to a digital twin established based on real marine platforms, simulations and loading under real loads were performed on a refined high-fidelity finite-element model, yielding dynamic response information that closely mirrored real-world conditions. A corresponding damage-recognition database was established to support the digital twin system. For the eight different directions, the model accuracy ranged from a minimum of 87.38% to a maximum of 92.27%. This represents a significant advancement compared to the performance of the original network. Empirical experiments substantiated the efficacy of the improved algorithm, demonstrating an impressive recognition accuracy of 93.75%. This achievement underscores the potential of this method to revolutionize damage identification for marine platforms, particularly under the distinctive conditions that these structures encounter. The integration of specialized modules and enhanced processing methodologies further bolster the accuracy of deep-learning-based damage identification and makes the building of digital twin models of offshore platforms feasible. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Deviated oil and gas wellbores were drilled by competent and experienced directional driller (DD) to deliver the wellbore's trajectory on target and on time. The variable human factor and rapid changes of various surface and downhole parameters present challenges for consistent performance every time. A dynamic physics-based machine learning (ML) algorithm leverages on digital twin data analytics and real-time downhole measurement to autonomously steer Rotary-Steerable System (RSS) drilling assembly was employed. This case study describes the methods, the algorithm learning, assimilates the data in real-time, and autonomously steers. Operator's in-field redevelopment plan consists of drilling two oil producers and one water injector side-tracking from donor wells. Due to congested nature of the platform with many producing wells through multi-stacked reservoirs, the wellbore profiles are complex 3D to tap into the various reservoir target sands and avoiding close approach to nearby drilled well. Meticulous well engineering and Bottom-Hole-Assembly (BHA) analysis were performed during the pre-drill planning stage to ascertain the directional performance of the RSS BHA, sensitivity study, offset directional performance and risks were thoroughly assessed. The autonomous steering algorithm models the directional performance tapping into the vast database of digital twin, expected directional performance, evaluates past yields, projecting ahead and constantly adjusting parameters such as steering aggressiveness, dogleg severity, turn rate, whilst staying within safety margin of anti-collision if any to deliver the wellbore to target. The speed of the computation from downhole sensor measurement, coupled with high-speed telemetry of the data to the surface allows for systematic increased in speed of real-time data processed, culminating to ML autonomous steering for RSS BHA to deliver a smoother wellbore that is not possibly with human manual calculation. The complex 3D well profile entails building wellbore angle from 40 degrees to 80 degrees before dropping to 67 degrees while turning azimuth from 190 degrees to 85 degrees with 3.5 degree per 30 meters dogleg severity. After initially side-tracking performed manually by the Directional Drillers at the rig site, autonomous steering algorithm was executed to directionally drill the wellbore through all the planned geological targets till well's total depth. 1224 meters were successfully drilled in autonomous mode without any DD intervention for 3 days of drilling with average 30-45 meters per hours rate-of-penetration. This resulted in 97 percent of wellbore autonomously steered and placed optimally through all planned geological targets, with 32 percent faster drilling compared to offsets. Eighty-six autonomous closed loop steering command flawlessly executed downlink saved fourteen hours of rig time, eliminating invisible loss time translating to faster on bottom drilling. The digital transformation with advances in ML and artificial intelligence, provided impetus drilling automation, to a paradigm shift on how we traditionally drill directional wellbores. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to identifying reskilling requirements, job merging pathways, and a tentative timeline for transforming offshore oil and gas drilling occupations amid the fourth industrial revolution (industry 4.0). The proposed algorithm focuses on potential job merging due to technological adoption. It introduces a scaling factor named digital readiness level to incorporate modulation factors (e.g., cost of development and deployment of new technologies, labour market dynamics, economic benefits, regulatory readiness, and social acceptance) that act as catalysts or hindrances for technology adoption. A feature-based approach is developed to assess the similarities between occupations, while a mathematical model is developed to project automation trajectories for each job under investigation. These facilitate the consideration of potential job merging scenarios and the associated timeline. Since technology adoption depends on the industry, region, occupation, and stakeholder's ability to manage the transformation, the proposed algorithm is presented as a case study on Canadian offshore oil and gas drilling occupations. However, this algorithm and approach can be applied to other industries or occupation structures. The proposed algorithm projects that the total number of personnel on board (POB) in a typical offshore drilling platform will be reduced to six by 2058. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of the proposed algorithm against variations in the feature values and weighting factors. It was found that when changing feature values and weighting factors up to ±20% of their original values, only one job that remains after 2058 follows three different job merging pathways, while others remain unchanged. Even the job that followed three different pathways was composed of the same source jobs compared to the corresponding job in the baseline results. Note to Practitioners - This research is inspired by the ongoing digital transformation initiatives and their socioeconomic impact. The adoption of digital technologies, such as automation, robotization, digital twins, data-driven decision-making systems, smart devices, and cloud computing technologies, gradually transform existing workplaces into digitally-enabled smart workplaces. Therefore, stakeholders must invest in training programs to reskill existing workforces and to orient prospective employees to work at these smart workplaces. If technology adoption occurs at a rapid or slower pace than workforce reformation, industries cannot gain the optimum benefit from their digital transformation initiatives. Also, human capital investments may not generate much benefit if technology adoption and workforce reformation occur at different rates. Therefore, this work presents a novel framework to predict future employment scenarios, particularly for the workers in offshore oil and gas drilling activities, along with a tentative timeline. Stakeholders can utilize the proposed framework to effectively plan the pace of technological adoption, future workforce transformation and human capital investments.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

The paper shares the framework and principles of Production Planning and Optimization and the way they drive the requirements and use of the Digital Twin to allow for the effective solution of the planning and optimization problem. In particular, it highlights the requirement of a model of record and an "evergreen" Digital Twin that should include the automated processes to assess the quality of the data consumed, to update the model when changes to the design or operation occur, and to calibrate the model using the latest data available. A Case Study of an implementation of a Short-Term Production Planning and Optimization (STPPO) solution for over a thousand wells and hundred platforms in three offshore gas fields in Thailand is presented. The solution helps the end user to carry the short-term production planning and optimization for the fields within the presented context, allowing for the definition of daily production and operational targets for all the wells in the asset to meet a desired production target while observing operating and product quality constraints. The Case Study is implemented within the PPO framework introduced in the paper thus allowing for the future functionality expansion, such as the integration to a Long-Term Production Planning and Optimization (LTPPO), through the incorporation of constraints focused on longer term value drivers of the asset, such as recovery and other reservoir management indicators. Because of this, the solution is well posed to help closing the gap between the Reservoir and Production/Operations personnel and to support multidisciplinary collaboration. The Case Study not only presents the technical details of the solution, but more importantly it highlights the challenges encountered in its implementation and adoption by the user. Specially, it underlines the importance to plan and implement continuous enhancement processes to align the solution and governance system, work processes, and operating culture to maximize user adoption and return on investment. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

	abstract = {A digital twin is a virtual model of a real-world structure (such as a device or equipment) which supports various problems or operations that occur throughout the life cycle of the structure through linkage with the actual structure. Digital twins have limitations as a general simulation method because the characteristic changes (motion, stress, vibration, etc.) that occur in the actual structure must be acquired through installed sensors. Additionally, it takes a huge computing cost to output changes in the structure’s characteristics in real time. In particular, in the case of ships and offshore structures, simulation requires a lot of time and resources due to the size of the analysis model and environmental conditions where the wave load acts irregularly, so the application of a different simulation methodology from existing ones is required. The order reduction method, which accurately represents the system’s characteristics and expresses them in a smaller model, can significantly reduce analysis time and is an effective option. In this study, to analyze the applicability of the order reduction method to the development of digital twins for offshore structures, the structural responses of a multi-connected floating offshore structure were estimated by applying the order reduction method based on distortion base mode. The order reduction method based on the distortion base mode predicts the responses by constructing an order-reduced conversion matrix consisting of the selected distortion base mode, based on the mode vector’s orthogonality and autocorrelation coefficients. The predicted structural responses with the reduced order model (ROM) were compared with numerical analysis results derived using the higher order boundary element method and finite element method with in-house code owned by the Korea Research Institute of Ship & Ocean Engineering and measured responses with a model test. When compared with the numerical analysis results, the structural responses were predicted with high accuracy in the wave direction and wave frequency band of the selected distortion base mode, but there are differences due to changed characteristics of the structure when compared with the results of the model test. In addition, differences were also seen in reduced order model evaluation with different sensor locations, and it was confirmed that the more similar the extracted distortion base modes of input sensor location set is to the distortion base modes of predicted location set, the higher accuracy is in predicting the structural responses. As a result, the performance of the reduced order model is determined by the distortion base mode selection method, the locations of the sensor, and the prediction for the structural response. © 2024 by the authors.},

For this strategy the COWI Virtual Inspection (CVI) routine is used. The CVI software facilitates Principal inspections using Reality Capture Models (RCM) and makes it possible to revisit the bridge structure without having to visit the structure on site. This project, utilizing CVI benefits, supports the digitization of Principal Inspection procedures and the product (RCM model).

	abstract = {Pipe stuck accident is one of the primary causes contributing to NPT (Non-Productive Time) in the drilling industry, incurring global financial losses amounting to hundreds of millions annually. For decades, Practices and techniques have been formulated and developed to avoid and tackle this downhole accident, while the early detection and proactive management are critical for effectively preventing this issue at its early stage. This paper presents the development and implementation of a novel digital Twin system, which amalgamates physics-based modeling and machine learning to facilitate real-time monitoring and early warning of pipe stuck while drilling. The system performs a real-time simulation of hook load, torque, and SPP (Standpipe Pressure) under various drilling states based on T&D and wellbore hydraulics models, which undergo verification and calibration within predefined computing cycles in order to enhance accuracy and reduce error margins. The PSRI (Pipe Stuck Risk), ranging from 0-100%, is based on ROC (Rate of change) of these three actual drilling parameters and the deviation of the simulated value from actual ones under different drilling states, is proposed to provide a comprehensive risk assessment over time series regardless of drilling state. A Continuous, real-time assessment of pipe stuck risk, categorized into low (green), medium (yellow), and high (red) levels, can be realized with thresholds for parameter deviation and ROC derived from historical data of wells with and without pipe stuck accidents and RFA (Random Forest Algorithm). The system is designed to alert users such as drillers or monitoring specialists with visual and auditory signals when a high-risk scenario is detected, prompting immediate preventative or corrective actions. Case studies have shown that the system could provide early warnings of high-risk of pipe stuck typically between 30 minutes to 2 hours ahead, particularly during back-reaming and tripping operation. This capability demonstrates the system's effectiveness in early identification and detection of this downhole accident under different drilling states. The system exemplifies a paradigm shift towards more efficient, safe, and predictive operational modes for early detection and warning of pipe stuck, demonstrating digital twin-driven technique could enhance the capture and utilization of digital data for cost containment and operational efficiency gains while drilling, thereby minimizing NPT and enhancing drilling optimization.

	abstract = {A multiphase flowmeter capable of adapting to varying well conditions and providing reservoir transient data is an essential tool for reliable production planning and optimization. This is the main driver for the development of a multiphase virtual flow metering (VFM) module, which is intended to be an add-on to the traditional production management system, (PMS), and as a value addition for the operator. Current physical flow metering systems have certain limitations such as a need for extensive calibration, and high capital and maintenance costs. Also, simultaneous monitoring of every producing well can be cost-prohibitive; thus, making it difficult to determine the field production efficiently and accurately. Having limited real-time field data adds a high degree of unreliability to any simulator predictions. The PMS integrated multiphase VFM described in this paper has been designed to specifically address some of these concerns in a cost-effective manner. This VFM system operates on simulated data sets as well as live field data, which are obtained at a much higher frequency to capture even short-duration transients in the field. An additional advantage of this system is that it can be deployed individually for each well, which facilitates single-well production metering. The VFM module, based on the dynamic multiphase flow simulator, has been developed by one of the industry leaders in simulating transient behavior of flow from a reservoir through the pipeline system. Virtual results such as pressures, temperatures, and multiphase flow rates from a digital-twin of the field are used as base results to predict the field flow rates. These predicted flow rates are compared with real-time data from instruments along the well tubing at the bottom-hole and wellhead. The VFM module processes deviations between predicted and real-time data, adjusts for factors such as instrument sensitivities and field data quality, and corrects the virtual flow rates even further towards more accurate predictions. To validate and confirm this, the model also outputs the confidence rating associated with the improved predictions. These predicted results and associated confidence levels are the final outputs from the VFM system. When integrated with the PMS, this VFM module can also configure alerts to the user in the case of any sudden risks or unwanted transients arising from the reservoir such as water breakthrough in a gas well. Upgrading the PMS with the new VFM module will empower the operator with reliable and accurate flow predictions and help overcome the production flow rate uncertainty In addition to removing dependency on field instrumentation, this VFM module will facilitate improved field production forecasting, and can help lead to timely intervention in potential production-loss scenarios caused by unexpected transients.

	abstract = {Blow-outs occurred on offshore platform and associated fires have been recurrent during the previous few decades, and poses a potential safety hazard to humans, property and the surrounding environment. Although the real-time forecast based on deep learning have shown promise in the fields of fire modelling and hazardous area evaluations, jet fire spatio-temporal modelling has not yet undergone sufficient investigation in complex ocean engineering cases like offshore platforms. This research therefore proposes a deep learning-based framework for jet fire spatio-temporal probabilistic real-time forecast by developing the Hybrid-VB-ConvSTnn model, which integratesConvGRU and variational Bayesian inference. And the significant hyperparameters were locally optimized through sensitivity analysis and finally identified as Monte Carlo (MC) sampling number m = 100 and dropout probability p = 0.1. By performance comparison with different models, the Hybrid-VB-ConvSTnn model shows competitive spatio-temporal forecasting capabilities in terms of both real-time (Inference time = 0.83s) and accuracy (R2 = 0.982). Moreover, the Hybrid-VB-ConvSTnn model could provide the additional uncertainty inferences based on the probability density of the Bernoulli distribution, which avoids the inherent shortcomings of “overconfidence” for traditional point-estimate models and lends credibility to flame boundary identification. The proposed framework could support the digital twin-based fire emergency management on offshore platforms by more comprehensive and robust risk evaluation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The challenge of integrating data from many data sources has persisted as an issue in several industry areas. With the evolution of technology in the upstream petroleum sector (i.e., exploration and production), the petroleum business must contend with technological silos from diverse service providers and suffers from the associated waste of time to locate data and information throughout siloed databases. Based on a thorough compilation of industry-oriented requirements in the form of use cases and competency questions, this document defines a domain ontology for defining entities in offshore petroleum production plants. The objective is to develop a uniform and clearly defined reference vocabulary to aid engineers and information technology professionals in labeling and relating production plant monitoring, simulation measures, and facilities. BFO is the top-level ontology, while GeoCore and a continuing version of the core ontology developed by the Industry Ontology Foundry (IOF) configure the middle-level ontologies. We have studied and combined several other resources to build the ontology, such as glossaries from the industry and related ontologies. The research resulted in a well-founded domain ontology that provides universals, defined classes, and relations that can be useful in several types of applications in the domain. We have demonstrated the utility of the ontology within an actual scenario in an offshore petroleum field in Brazil, where we conceived and applied the domain ontology.

The numerical simulation methods are useful tools in investigating the key mechanisms behind local scour. However, conventional simulation methods often neglect the microscopic sediment behavior, thus impeding a more profound understanding of the scour mechanism. In this research, the CFD-DEM method was applied to investigate the local scour around twin piles. And the coarse grain method and porous media model were incorporated to enhance simulation efficiency. The CFD-DEM model was constructed and validated using experimental data. Based on the validated model, a series of local scour simulations around twin piles were conducted under different arrangements. The time-development curves of scour depth were analyzed, and the variation of the equilibrium scour depth with pile spacing exhibits good agreement with the dates from previous studies. Based on the simulation results, the flow field, scour pit morphology, sediment flux, and microscopic behavior of sediment around twin piles were analyzed under different arrangements, and four key mechanisms of twin piles' local scour were observed and analyzed during this process. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Due to increasing concerns about global warming, demand for renewable energies has increased significantly. Among all sources of renewable energy, tidal energy is one of the most efficient. In order to accurately simulate and predict tidal current (TC), a novel two-stage methodology is suggested in this paper which not only can benefit the smart cities, but also can help for a more fitting landscape design in offshore areas. The integration of digital twin technology in landscape planning facilitates a comprehensive understanding of renewable energy systems in smart cities, enabling proactive decision-making and sustainable development strategies. To extract the most desirable characteristics from the dataset measuring TC speed and direction, the suggested method uses a unique fuzzy feature selection (FFS) technique. The Long short-term memory (LSTM) is further trained for precise prediction using the chosen characteristics. In order to improve the performance of the LSTM, an evolutionary optimization technique is developed to train the parameters of the proposed model to reach the best training objectives. The efficiency and precision of the model are evaluated using real tidal data from the Qinhuangdao beach. The outcomes demonstrate the proposed model's suitable performance and excellent precision in contrast to other well-known techniques like shallow NNs and well-known linear techniques. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

The steps of the procedure are automated within the software. The application of the procedure is illustrated in a case study considering a typical FPS representative of actual offshore scenarios. This retroanalysis procedure may be seen as the first stage for the development of a digital twin for FPS, and for the establishment of an integrity assessment methodology using the updated as-laid models.

	abstract = {Immersive virtual reality of our asset provides the avenue to optimize operations cost, enhance project and asset management with occupational safety risks reduction to our frontline operations. However, high development and deployment cost with solution unfamiliarity hinders asset owner's adoption. This paper discusses the strategic approach of embracing innovation culture to develop a sustainable immersive virtual reality platform by capitalizing in-house talents for generating early solution adoption at minimum risks and costs towards the business. Three prongs approach was executed to maximise value returns with the least investment cost by focusing on customer centricity, agile MVP solution development and fit-for-purpose investments. Customer centricity allows the team understanding on the customer wants and needs to craft a bespoke solution that effectively address the customer pain points and harmonizing with the existing organization digital ecosystem and governances. Agile MVP solution developments at specific stages enhances the team's understanding of the solution development based on Technology Readiness Level (TRL) by low resources utilisation, fit-for-purpose investments and faster deployment to further minimize business risks and accelerate operationalisation. The three-prong approach has managed to achieve proof of concept in just weeks and achieved final MVP pilot deployment in a few months for an onshore facility in the region with bare minimum investment resources and minimum risks to the business. Leveraging on the knowledge and invested resources, three replications of onshore facilities in the neighboring vicinity was achieved at accelerated pace utilizing the existing resources and upskilling the new teams on the development methodology by capitalizing in-house talents with plans for replication in offshore facilities in 2023 onwards in Malaysia and international operations in 2024. The solution has also managed to achieve TRL 6 with copyrighted intellectual property to further accelerate the adoption of solution across the businesses to achieve the growth plans of the solution. Acknowledging continuous improvement and sustainable operations, strategic alliances are ongoing within the organization to develop the ecosystem for effective management of the solution; and knowledge transfer programs are also designed to upskill identified personnel with minimum business impact to existing operations. In addition, the knowledge gained from developing the solution and insights to the customer needs; new features can be easily designed into the system to ensure relevancy to the customers. Adopting digital solutions is a daunting task with unfamiliarity of the solution and the high threshold of initial investment. By embracing culture of innovation and capitalizing on existing talents with minimum resource investments, organizations can overcome these thresholds to achieve faster value returns, early solution adoption and bespoke features catered towards customer centricity without major impacts towards the business and lower risks. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

	abstract = {This paper documents extensive comparison between one-way hydro-structural coupling model (OF-ABAQUS) and key findings from the physical model tests of a jack-up performed in TCOMS Ocean Basin. A generic jack-up model in elevated condition is considered at 1:30 scale. A series of model tests involving waves and current is performed on one of the jack-up legs for calibration of hydrodynamic coefficients, as well as on the whole jack-up for characterisation of its dynamic response. With the novel use of polycarbonate rods for the jack-up legs, stiffness similarity can be maintained at model-scale which allows direct strain measurements on the legs and meaningful connection force measurements at the spudcan modules and leg-to-hull connection modules. Using the OF-ABAQUS coupling model, the jack-up legs are first numerically represented as porous blocks and simulated in OpenFOAM to derive the hydrodynamic forces and additional fluid damping following Santo et al. (2018a), where static simulations are performed. The forces and damping are subsequently mapped into a Finite Element (FE) model of the jack-up in ABAQUS as a one-way transfer to derive its dynamic response following Li et al. (2022), where dynamic simulations are performed. The novelty of this paper is on the demonstration of the coupling model in capturing dynamic structural modes and responses in multiple degree-of-freedoms (DOFs) which is more realistic, unlike the earlier work by Santo et al. (2018a) who demonstrated the coupling model for an idealised single DOF system. Comparisons with model test results yield reasonably good agreement for all the cases considered, covering not just bending moment at one of the spudcan modules but also strain and leg-to-hull connection force of one of the legs. From the dynamic response spectra, the total system damping at the surge resonance frequency is adequately represented using the coupling model, which accounts for the additional fluid damping contributed by the effect of wave–current-structure blockage, or more precisely by the relative velocity. Most importantly, the use of single and consistent set of hydrodynamic coefficients for the derivation of hydrodynamic forces and additional fluid damping is demonstrated throughout all the cases. In contrast, the use of standard Morison equation will require tuning of the hydrodynamic coefficients and arbitrary increase in the hydrodynamic damping to match the measured peak response of each wave condition, resulting in huge uncertainties when evaluating the structural reliability in larger and unseen sea-states. This paper demonstrates that, once the hydrodynamic inputs are adequately represented, the corresponding dynamic structural responses can be derived accurately for any sea-states. The proposed approach can be regarded as a step improvement in accurate prediction of hydrodynamic forces and dynamic responses of space-frame structures, which has its important applications covering new-builds, re-assessment of old platforms, and structural health monitoring or digital twinning of offshore assets. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Cyber threats to ships and offshore platforms can have serious consequences, including accidents leading to loss of life, asset damage, or environmental impact.

	abstract = {The use of mathematical models in conjunction with sensor data in digital twins provides a powerful tool to optimize performance, improve efficiency, and reduce costs. Nevertheless, the reliability of model estimations depends on a careful consideration of the specific requirements of the system, the quality of the sensor data, and the level of technical expertise required to implement and validate those models. In this sense, two issues play a relevant role: the input data sampling frequency and the model estimation frequency. Since there are several data sources, like sensors, test and project data, each one with its own acquisition configuration, the input parameters are obtained with different time intervals. Some of them, such as process data, can be acquired in millisecond intervals, while laboratory data, in intervals of several months. On the other hand, slow dynamic phenomena such as erosion and corrosion do not require high model estimation frequency, which may demand a huge amount of computational resources for storage and processing. Hence, the implementation of digital twins demands the conditioning of the input data with algorithms like averages, resampling and interpolation, which may lead to different model estimations, according to the parameters used in the estimation. This paper explores the influence of different frequencies of partial calculations on the accuracy of a nonlinear model, the DNV erosion model, used to predict wear of oil and gas equipment caused by solid particle erosion. The DNV erosion model is based on empirical data and considers several input parameters such as pressure, temperature, flow and sand content. To investigate the impact of different frequencies of partial calculations, the model was run using several temporal resolutions ranging from daily to yearly calculations, using real production data from the Volve field. The outcomes suggest that temporal resolution can have a significant impact on the accuracy of the cumulative wear predictions, mainly, due to the nonlinearity of the applied model and high variability of process parameters. This paper presents important insights into the use of nonlinear models in predicting wear due to solid particle erosion, and highlights the importance of considering the temporal resolution of partial calculations when developing and employing such models. These findings have important implications for the development and optimization of oil and gas equipment used in harsh environments where solid particle erosion is a significant concern. © Copyright 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

The intended purpose of the system is to both train operators of the leak detection system in its use and also provide high situational awareness to those tasked with monitoring pipeline deployments. The visual digital twin system uses gaming engine technology to achieve high visual quality. We also construct a novel software system enhancement to incorporate live data streams into the gaming engine environment. This allows real-time driving of gaming engine visualization elements with which we may augment the gaming engine environment. In terms of visualization, we focus on addressing problems of large ranges of multiple scales and providing high situational awareness which minimize operator fatigue and cognitive load. We show how multiple camera views in combination with a convenient user interface can help to address these issues. We demonstrate a digital twin system for leak detection. We show its realtime operation in a gaming engine environment with the ability to instantaneously incorporate outside data sources into the visualizations. We demonstrate using simulated pipeline flow data from sensors such as pressure, temperature, etc. This is visualized in the context of a subsea pipeline on a sea floor. Given the large range of scales, we demonstrate how we can view both the full kilometer scale pipeline and smaller subsections in the context of specific sensor data streams. The overall system demonstrates a novel combination of advanced software systems which incorporates real-time data stream with visualization using a high-fidelity gaming engine.

	abstract = {Digital twins are increasingly being used to address challenges and support decision-making in the offshore industry. Digital twins are defined here as a virtual representation of a physical asset, along with its environment and processes, comprised of integrated models that are updated through data exchange to provide decision-making support over its lifecycle. The developers and users of these digital twins, the decision makers using information obtained from the results of these digital twins, and the individuals affected by decisions based on such digital twins are focused on understanding if a digital twin and its results can be trusted. This concern can be mitigated through the appropriate application of verification and validation. Verification is typically defined as ensuring that the computerized model and its implementation are compliant with its requirements and specifications as detailed in its conceptual models, mathematical models, or other constructs (that is, “Did I build the thing right?”). Validation is defined as a process of determining the degree to which a digital twin is an accurate representation of the real world with respect to an intended use (“Did I build the right thing?”). This paper first establishes a modular and scalable ontology for digital twins that consolidates many existing definitions and descriptions into a format that is conducive to supporting verification and validation activities. Building on this ontology, two frameworks are presented: one framework for performing verification and validation on a developed digital twin and a separate framework for performing independent verification and validation on a third-party created digital twin. The goal of these frameworks is to define, determine, generate, and document the information needed to assess the digital twin's credibility and justify using the digital twin for the specified use case or application. Additionally, considerations of related aspects, such as digital twin criticality, are also discussed. Copyright © 2024, The Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers},

Considering this complex challenge, this paper describes the development of an application through a cloud-based platform that integrates the operation and maintenance phases of industrial plants through a Digital Twin for the management of risk in Oil and Gas operating units. The platform integrates project data as well as process documentation on the digital twin database, providing a systematic overview of risk analysis, safety control, and management of the operating units. By creating an integrated database, operators can access information, models, and processes, and perform simulations through web access and mobile. For the Process Safety application on an FPSO (Floating Production Storage & Offloading), information from risk analyses was extracted through OCR, Regular Expressions, and then contextualized and linked to the 3D model. To implement the solution, it was created an integrated system based on protocols for consuming and updating data, documents, and models involved. This includes a middleware for 3D engineering models and a document integrator for risk analysis processes, along with a dynamic visual representation of the sequencing of actions when process intervention is required. The solution presented in this paper offers valuable recommendations and evidence to support interventions and audits. Furthermore, it centralizes access to engineering information, significantly reducing industry professionals’ time spent searching and validating data across different operating systems, leading to a reduction of up to 75%. The system also generates simulated dynamic visual representation in the digital environment to showcase the sequencing of actions required during interventions in the process. This approach has led to an expected improvement in the recordable incident rate and a significant reduction in the time required to plan shutdowns and turnarounds. Overall, the platform's efficacy is demonstrated through its ability to streamline processes and enhance safety protocols. © Copyright 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {Natural gas jet fire induced by igniting blowouts has the potential to cause critical structure damage and great casualties of offshore platforms. Real-time natural gas jet fire plume prediction is essential to support the emergency planning to mitigate subsequent damage consequence and ocean pollution. Deep learning based on a large amount of Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations has recently been applied to real-time fire modeling. However, existing approaches based on point-estimation theory are ‘over-confident’ when prediction deficiency exists, which reduce robustness and accuracy for emergency planning support. This study proposes probabilistic deep learning approach for real-time natural gas jet fire consequence modeling by integrating variational Bayesian inference with deep learning. Numerical model of natural gas jet fire from offshore platform is built and the natural gas jet fire scenarios are simulated to construct the benchmark dataset. Sensitivity analysis of pre-defined parameters such as MC (Monte Carlo) sampling number m and dropout probability p is conducted to determine the trade-off between model's accuracy and efficiency. The results demonstrated our model exhibits competitive accuracy with R2 = 0.965 and real-time capacity with an inference time of 12 ms. In addition, the predicted spatial uncertainty corresponding to spatial jet fire flame plume provides more comprehensive and reliable support for the following mitigation decision-makings compared to the state-of-the-art point-estimation based deep learning model. This study provides a robust alternative for constructing a digital twin of fire and explosion associated emergency management on offshore platforms. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to analyze the implementation of MR Elastomer (MRE) Tensioner system in FPSO-Shuttle Tanker in-tandem system to mitigate fishtailing instability. It is also to identify the opportunity for digital twin implementation for similar application. Fishtailing instability in the FPSO-Shuttle Tanker in-tandem system, and the implementation of MRE Tensioner in this system are analyzed by performing mooring-vessel-coupled time-domain analysis utilizing Texas A&M in-house CHARM3D program. Two types of FPSO are considered, which are turret FPSO and spreadmoor FPSO. West Africa metocean condition is used in the simulation as this region contains significant number of FPSO. First, two-body frequency-domain WAMIT simulation is performed to obtain the required vessel hydrodynamic data. These data, together with mooring, riser and hawser data are inputted into time-domain analysis (CHARM3D). The MRE Tensioner is modelled in CHARM3D and it is based on the physical MR Elastomer and Elastomer Tensioner system. The MRE Tensioner is then used as hawser connection on FPSO side. A simulation of FPSO-Shuttle Tanker with fishtailing instability is performed and used as baseline (called Fairlead case). Hawser angle, which is the angle the hawser deflects due to out-of-phase sway and yaw motions between the FPSO and Shuttle Tanker, is calculated in the post-simulation to measure the severity of fishtailing instability. Two MRE Tensioner cases for each FPSO type are simulated to investigate the stiffness level required to suppress fishtailing instability. The first MRE Tensioner corresponds to the 0A energizing current, which corresponds to the lowest MRE Tensioner stiffness. The second MRE Tensioner corresponds to the current level to get the appropriate MRE Tensioner stiffness that results in significant fishtailing suppression. The Fairlead case exhibits significant hawser angle dynamics indicating fishtailing instability in both turret FPSO-Shuttle Tanker case and spreadmoor FPSO-Shuttle Tanker case. However, spreadmoor FPSO-Shuttle Tanker case exhibits benign motion than turret FPSO-Shuttle Tanker case. In MRE Tensioner cases, no significant improvement is observed in MRE Tensioner case with 0A energizing current or with the lowest tensioner stiffness. Significant suppression is observed when 5A energizing current is implemented in turret FPSO-Shuttle Tanker case. Fishtailing dampening is also observed when 10A energizing current is implemented in spreadmoor FPSO-Shuttle Tanker case. The novelty of MRE Tensioner is its ability to adjust its stiffness which enables it to be utilized as means to suppress fishtailing instability for a given metocean condition by utilizing it as hawser connection. This in turn provides an opportunity to improve hydrocarbon offloading uptime. Furthermore, having the ability to control hawser connection stiffness through electrical current signal provides an opportunity for digital twin implementation. © Copyright 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {The oil and gas industry confronts formidable challenges in optimizing production and ensuring the secure and efficient transportation of hydrocarbons while minimizing production downtime and intervention costs. These challenges are particularly dramatic in offshore and subsea environments, where harsh environmental conditions intensify flow assurance issues. The lack of instrumentation and the potential malfunctioning of existing instruments in severe conditions contribute to operational uncertainties. In response, this paper presents a comprehensive approach employing digital twins and transient flow simulators to address these challenges and enhance operational excellence. The focal point of this study is dynamic production surveillance and management that leverages digital twins and predictive workflows to predict and optimize the production efficiently. At the core of this approach is the online flow assurance (OFA) solution, centered around digital twin that is powered by robust dynamic multiphase flow simulators together with live production data to predict the real-time multiphase flow behavior of the wells and pipeline network. The application accurately computes and reports production data, even those not directly available from the field. The innovative way in the digital twin concept is to create multiple instances of this same core to allow it to run for various operational scenarios, in different timescale, all at the same time. This web-based solution allows users to gain flow assurance and operational insights from any location and at any time. Integration with reservoir and process systems ensures the holistic use of its potential. This integration extends beyond complementing production or reservoir systems to enhancing the complete digital oil field system. Furthermore, the results produced by the OFA serve as essential inputs into the process simulator, amplifying overall process efficiency, operator training, and reducing operational risks. The study underscores the industry's ongoing shift towards digitalization, citing McKinsey & Co.'s report that effective digital technology use could lead to significant reductions in capital expenditures and operating costs across upstream and downstream operations (Martinotti & Jim Nolten, 2014). This paper discusses the integration of digital twins into the flow assurance framework, highlighting their role in providing a comprehensive understanding of the production system. The digital twin's ability to simulate and predict the behavior of the physical system allows for proactive decision-making, ensuring safety, reliability, and economic viability in oil and gas production. In summary, as industry navigates the complexities of subsea environments and endeavors to meet carbon-neutral aspirations, integrating digital twin technology into flow assurance strategies emerges as a pivotal solution. This paper unravels the potential of digital twins in revolutionizing flow assurance practices, offering a paradigm shift from reactive to proactive operational management in the oil and gas sector.

	abstract = {Surrogate models are vital for offshore wind farm optimisation, or digital twin for rapid execution. Reliable surrogates are difficult to make, especially for large wind farms and for fatigue loads. One limitation is the high resolution of turbulence needed for fatigue calculations and the vast size of a wind farm. We present code optimisations for implementing the Mann model for farm-sized flows, which are infeasible otherwise. Additionally, we present a case study of a full load surrogate for the Lillgrund offshore wind farm using large turbulence box generation in aeroelastic wind farm simulations using HAWC2Farm. Various mappings between the wind field in front of a turbine and the corresponding turbine structural fatigue loads are presented. The best-performing surrogate model, using a proper orthogonal decomposition of the input space with an artificial neural network, is able to significantly reduce the error in fatigue load estimates by as much as a factor of 5 compared to conventional methods. The presented recommendations are crucial to generating reliable wind farm load surrogates for wind farm optimisation purposes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Irregular ocean waves contribute to random and non-linear hydrodynamic forces on marine and offshore platforms, in particular those made of slender bodies such as jack-ups. Keeping track of the structural fatigue, integrity, and reliability renders benefits to these platforms such as enabling predictive maintenance and risk-based decision support. While computational techniques are useful in providing insights to deepen our understanding of the physics involved, these are resource-intensive and not suited for predictive capabilities. Here we introduce an effective deep learning method based on Long Short Time Memory (LSTM) to predict unsteady hydrodynamic forces on jack-up legs, which are mainly governed by non-linear drag forces, as well as dynamic responses of the jack-up in terms of reaction forces and hull motion. The numerical OF-ABAQUS solver (one-way fluid-structure coupling) designed for jack-up by Li et al. (2022, 2023) is used to generate a database for the deep neural network, which takes in wave elevation time series as the input. A leaky non-linear rectification is used to trace the relationship between wave elevation (as the input) and hydrodynamic forces as well as structural responses (as the outputs). The LSTM model is trained using a stochastic gradient descent method, and the results are compared with the full-order numerical simulations. Once the hyper-parameters of the LSTM algorithm are identified, further tuning for each sea-state is not required. Instead, the same LSTM algorithm can be used for different sea-states. The predictions made with our LSTM model are real-time, 96,000 times faster than the full-order simulations, within a 6% error threshold, and use a negligible amount of central processing unit (CPU) power. This powerful tool can be used to obtain real-time predictions using computers on offshore platforms without high-performance computers inland. Further, the proposed LSTM-based method can be applied to create digital twins for jack-up platforms. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

With digital twin technology, the industrial organization can be assumed in a way that they implement a sustainable solution with stability and predictability. By using MATLAB and Simulink, in this paper, a digital twin was demonstrated for Electro-Mechanical parts of the drilling for oil and gas industries. Hence, every single element of electrical and mechanical components was defined including the rotational parts separately, then by connecting those parts, the entire process in a closed-loop control system can be controlled. Having this digital twin, healthy data was generated for the situation that the system is working properly, as well as failure data that can be assigned for those components that are prone to wear and failure. Considering a fault in the digital twin in every specific part of the equipment, fault data was generated that can be used for data analysis and machine learning to find a Remaining Useful Life (RUL). To show how it is possible, in the next step, a digital twin for a triplex hydraulic pump that is crucial equipment in the oil and gas industries was investigated, then by having a simulation in healthy and faulty situations the required data were generated. Having data, an RUL was defined by implementing a data analysis and machine learning that can be implemented to have predictive maintenance for the system and it is shown how building a digital twin and having predictive maintenance for our system may boost productivity while decreasing unexpected downtime, which is costly and time-consuming. © Copyright 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {The energy industry is undergoing fundamental change with industry 4.0 enabling intelligent operations, production optimization, prescriptive maintenance and efficiency boosting, embedding insights, hyper-automation and enhance agility across production assets with the objectives of increasing productivity, delivering cost savings, and improving superior customer experience. Leveraging digital solution accelerators, APIs and network gateways connectivity for event data analytics, these digital native products can expedite development on energy assets with infrastructure as code - the single source of truth. Adopting insight-driven digital engineering is crucial for the energy industry to remain resilient, profitable, and sustainable in meeting net-zero carbon emission in the energy transition. There is urgent need for the energy industry to partner with the digital native companies and integrators to co-create solutions in driving digital enablement across oil and gas, offshore developments, LNGs, renewables, hydrogen, and utilities. The energy industry does not need to reinvent the will, as the technology exist. What is needed is collaborations of ideas and application of disruptive use cases across the digital and energy industry to pivot sustainable novel solutions for the ecosystem. Deployments of autonomous systems with AI for remote operations optimization, IoT connectivity for pervasive platform across assets, digital twin for visibility of entire assets, edge computing for resilience and low cost of operations, data analytic platform for prescriptive maintenance, and the protection of critical infrastructural assets in an ecosystem of vulnerabilities, are key processes for net-zero carbon emission and sustainability in the energy industry. The energy and digital tech leaders must collaborate to revolutionize the energy industry with insight-driven digital engineering in this age of digital disruptions. Designing for speed in an EPC project without compromising quality relies on digital information from concept and FEED, to inform a digital engineering solution platform, which have resulted in enabling Energy Operators get to a final investment decision up to 45% faster. A typical use case is where an EPC company begun the process of reducing their engineering software and technology portfolio from over 175 distinct products down to less than 32. The benefits include expedited evaluation of concepts through process simulation software, automated plant layout and piping designs through solution accelerators enablement, and coordinated estimates tied to the engineering information. With over 200 digital accelerator models deployed in the first year of an energy operating asset, the solution correctly identified 49 major early warnings, a value of $16.8 million saving in ROI was achieved. Thus, with support for the entire concept to FEED process now enabled with integrated digital design, layout and estimating software, EPCs can explore and optimize options for both offshore greenfield and brownfield projects quickly and efficiently with solution accelerators, providing Energy Operators the highest value from their investments.

	abstract = {Nowadays, offshore operators have an increased requirement to reduce the operational risks while performing offshore natural resources exploitation. This, in particular, applies to critical steel catenary risers whose long-term integrity with respect to fatigue and extreme events is key for safe operations: due to their dynamic behavior, risers are one of the most critical assets being subject to severe environmental and operation loads, which shall be studied in detail at the design stage. Given the large number of external actions and the riser complex response, riser engineering is typically affected by several uncertain parameters, therefore an accurate monitoring of its integrity is key to ensure safe operations in the short-term and gain the necessary knowledge in the medium to long-term thus enabling design optimization, asset maintenance and life extension. These considerations place risers monitoring as a central technological theme for the offshore energy industry. The design and realization of an adequate riser monitoring is a complex activity requiring: i) the deep knowledge of riser physics to support a holistic assessment of the parameters to be monitored, ii) the direct access to modern technologies, as digital twin, to enable the realization of even more efficient and innovative monitoring solutions tailored for the specific projects’ needs. In this context, Saipem has a privileged viewpoint given its long-term experience in rigid riser engineering, construction, and installation (as EPCI contractor responsible for the SURF scope) combined with strong capability in providing integrate, novel and fully customized solutions for underwater assets monitoring through its Sonsub business. This paper investigates the benefits coming from this integrated approach where the monitoring system is conceived, realized, and installed as an integral part of the related riser and explores the potential advantages linked to the implementation of data interpretation features capable to support riser system integrity analysis along the asset operational life. This paper provides also an overview of the challenges behind riser monitoring systems realization passing through the main development phases: from the initial qualification and engineering phase to the installation and integration testing. To offer a very pragmatic view on the topic, the paper presents a brief summary of Saipem recent experience in developing and qualifying riser monitoring systems for some Brazilian projects specifically designed for steel catenary riser configurations. © Copyright 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

Meanwhile, the concept of digital twin itself is yet to be clearly defined in wind farm sector. Our primary contribution lies in investigating the potential for transferring knowledge of industrial digital twins for the wind farm industry. Through a comprehensive literature study, we explored the digital twin concept within the context of wind farm applications. Also, we conducted a comparative analysis of digital twin frameworks employed in wind farm and manufacturing sectors. We aim to identify commonalities and differences between these frameworks and to determine how they could be adapted to the unique requirements of the offshore wind sector. A case study is presented, wherein the Industry 4.0 standard framework, Asset Administration Shell (AAS), is conceptually applied to the wind farm sector. Additionally, we briefly explored the AASX Package Explorer and concluded that implementing the AAS could be a promising option for enhancing digital twin functionality in offshore wind farms, and for achieving interoperability in line with Industry 4.0 standard. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {As the demand for harvesting offshore energy increases worldwide, the need for slender structures, such as marine risers and power cables, will increase. The dominating loads for deep water applications will primarily be caused by current-structure interactions, where vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) are known to be a challenging response type to handle correctly during design. Semi-empirical time-domain models are promising for VIV prediction, but uncertainties related to simplifications in the hydrodynamic load model and empirical parameters lead to over-conservative designs, where the parameters are estimated from model tests within a relatively low Reynolds number range. The aim of this paper is to present an efficient tool to estimate empirical hydrodynamic parameters directly from test data. To illustrate the method, the hydrodynamic parameters were estimated from pure cross-flow VIV model tests in a steady current with Reynolds numbers in the range of 40,000-120,000. The parameters were updated sequentially by using a Bayesian optimization framework, with the aim of minimizing an objective function that incorporates the response errors between time-domain VIV simulations and model test data. It is shown that three empirical parameters can be obtained simultaneously, resulting in small response errors but the optimal parameters were overly sensitive to variations in the flow velocity. The optimal parameters were used to reconstruct the drag amplification related to cross-flow VIV and in forced motion simulations to illustrate how the parameters in the load model would map into the traditional formulation in terms of the added mass and excitation coefficient. © 2023},

Digital twin simulators for complex dynamic operation systems such as shipboard cranes, allow the operators to practice demanding operations in a risk-free immersive environment with various scenarios. This paper presents the process of developing a digital twin-based simulation tool designed for shipboard crane operations. It is based on co-simulation using the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard. This allows for the integration of the operation scenarios with different physical domain models, including such as the ship, environmental forces, hydraulic power systems, and controllers. In addition, the digital twin has opened up new opportunities for the optimization of maritime systems. It can be used to identify the optimal operating conditions, predict potential risks, and provide onboard support to the operator.

	abstract = {Effectively managing oil rim reservoirs poses significant challenges due to uncertainties in predicting oil rim movements. This leads to production losses, high gas-to-oil ratios (GOR), increased water cut, and the risk of losing the oil rim. To address these issues, a proof of concept for an early warning system was developed, utilizing innovative data analytics techniques and leveraging well data, such as pressure and temperature measurements, to detect changes in water cut as an indicator of oil rim movement. The workflow involves data extraction, pre-processing, regime detection, trend analysis, and exception-based surveillance with alerts. A selected oil-producing well with ample flow line pressure, temperature, and well test data was used to test the workflow. Pipesim modeling indicated a clear correlation between temperature and water cut, validated through sensitivity analysis at different GOR levels. The technology provides an integrated workflow covering data management, analytics, an event detection alert algorithm, and a visualization dashboard. It is not intended to replace existing oil rim management tools but serves as an additional decision support tool when reliable models are unavailable. The early warning system presented in this paper addresses the limitations of current methods by offering a proactive approach to detect fluid movements and mitigate production losses. By integrating novel data analytics techniques and utilizing readily available well data, operators can make informed decisions and take timely actions, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of oil rim management in petroleum operations. This technology serves as a valuable decision support tool in the absence of reliable models, ultimately enhancing the overall performance of oil rim management strategies.

	abstract = {Kicks are one of the main safety concerns in drilling operations, especially offshore, since they could lead to a blowout if not detected as soon it starts. Sometimes kick indicators can be smoothed and it might be difficult to determine if there is a real kick or another physical event taking place within the well. The fluid temperature effect might be misinterpreted as a kick migration, generates a false alarm, and stop operations until there is enough evidence that it is not a kick, due to the severe consequences that it can lead in a real occurrence. These thermal effects can be considered inherent to the operation, given that it is natural to deep wells reach higher temperatures in the subsurface and thus the fluid could experiment an expansion associated with an increase in pressure. The proposed calculation presented in this work acts in a way to reduce the time used to evaluate these specific situations in real-time and allows a safety operation resume. After development tests, the new false-kick module was included in a drilling digital twin software, currently in use by a drilling engineers’ team, on a 24×7 service inside the client Real-Time Operation Center (RTOC). While performing tests at the homologation server/database, the results were in agreement with the expectations, proving that around 40 minutes of rig time could be saved for each false kick detection. These results add value to the operations as it provides more sensitive information to be taken into account while evaluating a kick scenario and shortens the time frame reaction to deal with an inconclusive pressure/ flow check. The novelty is the usage of a drilling digital twin to include a false kick analysis, enabling it to detect whether just a thermal effect occurred instead of a real kick. The numerical simulation already runs robust data monitoring, evaluating a big amount of data in real-time, and the new feature helps reducing operation risks to resume operations faster. © Copyright 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {Despite on-the-job assistance technology is getting popular in the Smart Operator 4.0 literature, non-routine work also requires highly-skilled and pre-trained workers to prevent serious errors and keep high efficiency and safety levels. The question that motivates this study is: ‘is it possible to train industrial workers for what exactly is coming instead of preparing them for a large set of scenarios - even very unlikely ones?’. This work proposes: (i) a structured On-the-Job Training strategy for non-routine tasks, called ‘training-on-the-go’ or ‘prescriptive training’, according to which a Prescriptive Analytics module schedules the training sessions not long before the actual performance, but only when and if needed; (ii) a proof-of-concept of a game-based training system where virtual scenes and context of an industrial site are faithfully recreated thanks to digital twin data and models; (iii) the use of evolutionary-based fuzzy cognitive maps (E-FCM) for the extraction of the workers’ implicit procedural knowledge and for the comparison of mental models of experienced vs. inexperienced workers to assess potential misconceptions or flaws in their decision-making process. This work contributes to the evolution of worker training paradigms and systems from the perspective of human-centric cyber-physical production systems and aims for current gaps in workforce training, i.e. poor timeliness and effectiveness, limited context and industrial information integration, and scarce focus on the experts’ implicit knowledge. An application study with a non-routine task on an offshore oil platform demonstrates how the proposed system facilitates knowledge transfer, offers situational awareness and sustains the workforce competence development process. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The digitalization of production and processing systems has significant potential to greatly benefit the Oil & Gas industry, as well as for Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) and for green hydrogen (H2) production using offshore renewable energy. Digital Twins, in particular, play a critical role in not only designing new applications but also enhancing existing machinery. This integration of advanced technologies empowers the industry to achieve unprecedented levels of efficiency, controllability, and predictive maintenance, ensuring a more competitive and sustainable future. This paper focuses on developing an embedded Digital Twin for an electric subsea valve actuator, which was modeled using state-space equations based on its physical counterpart's components. Its state-space matrices are continually updated through controller output signals and recalculating system parameters, including mechanical and volumetric efficiencies and the production valve signature, based on data from sensors. To achieve continuous updates, an online and recursive system identification technique employing a Kalman Filter is used to update the Digital Twin's parameters. Throughout the experiment, a MATLAB script subjected the Digital Twin model to tests utilizing data from the physical counterpart. Both scenarios, with and without online and recursive parameter identification, were explored. Remarkably, the Digital Twin adeptly adapted its parameters, mirroring the behavior of its physical counterpart. The findings conclusively exhibited that the embedded Digital Twin enables condition monitoring of the physical counterpart, bridging sensor gaps and compensating for sensor faults. Such proactive maintenance capabilities enhance equipment reliability significantly. This feature is used in this study to increase the fault-tolerance of an electric Subsea Valve Actuator, providing a digital redundancy to critical components such as position and torque sensors. © Copyright 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {The global oil and gas companies are aggressively adopting new digital technologies for process improvement, enhancing safety, reducing asset down time, and reducing overall cost of production to stay competitive. The Digital Oil Field (DOF) is the idea of digitalizing the oil field operations to improve production performance and collaboration both within and outside the organization. This paper discusses the giant leap taken by ONGC towards digitalization of one of its largest deep-water oil and gas field development – the KG-DWN-98/2. Integrated Operations System (IOPS) presently being implemented in ONGC, comprises of data collection and analytics modules, automation tools and collaboration enablers integrated together for streamlined decision-making, easily accessible expertise and safe collaborative co-location of essential personnel. Paper discusses the existing challenges being faced by ONGC in production optimization, asset maintenance and collaboration. IOPS system is proposed as a solution to overcome these challenges. With the help of IOPS, the concept of "Digital-Twin" is introduced in ONGC. The method of developing a digital twin for the entire field from reservoir to separator using existing industry proven software with limited customization are discussed in detail. The methodology adopted for acquiring field data, analysis of the acquired data and utilizing the business intelligence acquired for optimizing production and ultimately leading to business transformation is discussed. The use of advanced digital collaboration environments to effectively utilize the technical expertise located at various geographical locations to solve complex technical issues and provide quick resolution to business problems are discussed in detail. The usage of Big data for predictive analytics to move the decision making from a post event reactive approach to proactive responsive approach is briefly discussed. The functioning of different components of the IOPS system, the interconnection between various analytics modules, the flow of data between modules to form a digital twin of the field and the expected benefits of the system are discussed in detail. The system is expected to improve production uplift by 2 to 3% and reduce the overall OPEX cost by 10 to 20%. The system is expected to increase the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) of the critical assets by enabling Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). © Copyright 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

The digital twin technology is very important in digital and intelligent development of underground gas storage. The digital twin of underground gas storage which contains data layer, 3D layer, simulation layer, logic layer, interaction layer, is constructed. Based on the five layers, the digital twin system of underground gas storage is established, which contains production data management subsystem, process simulation optimization subsystem and intelligent 3D display subsystem. The digital and intelligent technology based on digital twin and digital twin system of underground gas storage integrates all the needed data with 3D models visually.

Finally, functions of offline scheme planning, online monitoring and optimization, future working condition prediction and abnormal working condition warning are realized for the whole process of underground gas storage by the digital and intelligent technology. The digital and intelligent technology is implemented to enable the optimization of the injection-production scheme, dehydration and hydrate control for underground gas storage.

	abstract = {Digital twins have been developed in the oil and gas industry to support a more precise risk assessment that enables performance improvement of offshore structures throughout their life span. Usually, a floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit is required to exploit oil fields in deep and ultra-deepwater with the postponement of the decommissioning stage, leading to increasing maintenance costs due to aging effects. This paper proposes an adaptive methodology for the development of a digital twin that performs automated numerical analysis via finite element model updating (FEMU) based on coupled systems of a high-fidelity FPSO hull model. The methodology employs a three-cargo tank length finite element (FE) model to receive data and automatically solve multiple numerical analyses. If during results checking any alert level is reached by any structural component, a more complex structural reliability method is applied to provide failure probability considering material strength statistical distribution. The application herein investigates the effects of corrosion, but other phenomena can be considered within the developed framework. A corrosion prediction model is used to create different hypotheses of degradation for bottom plates, while data provided from coupled systems are considered to investigate the effect of deterioration. The results demonstrate a consistent probability of failure when compared to the evolution of the predicted corrosion during service life. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Japan Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineers (JASNAOE).},

	abstract = {Flow Assurance and Process solutions are the key drivers for design and efficient operation in terms of maintaining system integrity and profitability. Subsea and Export systems rely on modelling multiphase thermodynamic calculations for design and real-time monitoring systems. Topsides and Onshore systems require modelling of unit operations, control schemes and equipment specific operating envelopes. Due to these vastly different requirements, the oil and gas (O&G) industry relies on different software/tools to understand flow assurance vs process conditions. Achieving a solution that provides a holistic perspective helps in preventing individual system contractor oversight, in understanding how individual system designs operate and fit together, in supporting integrated procedures development/verification, and can act as an operator training simulator (OTS) system. A fully integrated process digital twin with both physics based and digital capabilities is required to achieve the above objective. The Integrated Dynamic Model (IDM) uses physics based hydraulic and thermophysical calculations in the design phase to inform integrated system responses that drive design decisions. In the operate phase, the IDM uses the field sensor data in real-time to monitor the field, trigger alarms/alerts for specific events, identify process anomalies like leaks and restrictions, assess hydrate formation potential and provide predictive functionalities to determine system states based on an operator action. Transient events can trigger responses across system interfaces and may lead to hydrocarbon release into the atmosphere, production losses and system integrity/safety issues. The IDM helps in complete process digitalization, field operation verification, process optimisation, decarbonization and improving system integrity. With the utilization of the historical field data, the IDMs are further able to learn and understand field-specific nuances that further supports operator readiness. The IDM is novel to the industry due to its capability to use production analysis data, equipment operating envelopes, control logic sequences and field data in real-time to provide informed decisions for integrated system design and operations. This paper will touch upon the integrated modelling and digital capabilities of the IDM through the lens of a couple of case studies - one in the design and one in the operate phase.

	abstract = {Structural assessment is a main concern when designing and operating any sort of offshore structure. This assessment is meant to ensure that the structural integrity is preserved along the lifespan of the asset, withstanding the worst sea-states that will be encountered and making sure that the accumulated fatigue damage will not jeopardize its structural integrity neither. The purpose of this paper is to present a fast and reliable hydroelastic model. This model is based on time-domain tight-coupling of a three-dimensional FEM (finite element method) linear structural model and a three-dimensional FEM seakeeping hydrodynamics model. In order to reduce the computational cost of structural dynamic simulations, the high-fidelity structural solution is projected onto the modal basis to obtain the modal matrix system and to extend the response amplitude operators (RAO) to the modal responses (MRAO). From there, the number of structural degrees of freedom can be greatly reduced by retaining only those eigenmodes preserving most of the structural elastic energy. The use MRAOs and/or the large reduction in structural degrees of freedom allows us to: first, quickly analyse the large number of loadcases required on the design stage; and second, to implement a digital twin for structural health monitoring in operational conditions. The paper also presents an application case of the developed methodology. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Understanding the oceans requires accurate monitoring and suitable test environments for conducting hypothesis-driven simulations. Marine digital twins can be part of the solution to foster knowledge on the way to a sustainable blue economy. Herein we adapt the current literature on digital twins (DTs) in the industrial domain to the marine domain and reinterpret the dimensions of DTs to build a marine digital twin (MDT). These dimensions are the physical entity, the data, the services, and the virtual models. The latter represents the core aspect of DTs that bridges between the other dimensions. It consists of graphical models, physical models and especially methodologies of artificial intelligence as well as machine learning algorithms. The presented dimensions provide a conceptual view to identify missing components when building MDTs and provide researchers and developers guidance for developing MDTs. To exemplify these dimensions, we present two of our projects where MDTs are developed: NorthSat-X and AI4DTE. In NorthSat-X essential climate variables of the North Sea are incorporated into a MDT. Moreover, in AI4DTE a digital prototype is developed to monitor anomalies of offshore wind farms. At the end, we identified that MDTs face three main challenges that are subject of the paper's discussion: scalability, interoperability, and explainability. © 2024},

The proposed damage identification framework consists of two models (namely one OSP model and one damage identification model). The OSP model adopts the multi-objective Lichtenberg algorithm (MOLA) to perform the sensor number/location optimization to make a good balance between the sensor cost and the modal calculation accuracy. In the damage identification model, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-Bayesian method is developed to calculate the structural damage ratios based on the modal information obtained from the sensory measurements, where the uncertainties of the structural parameters are quantified.

The twine Reynolds number is (Formula presented.), making it experience various local drag coefficients. The DT was built with OrcaFlex (OF) aiming at: (i) avoiding over- or under-designing the system; (ii) supporting the scale-up of the system; and (iii) estimating the costs and/or the impact of our offshore operations. Therefore, we present an attempt to build an accurate DT using data from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP). We developed a three-cycle validation: (i) initial guess applying Naumov’s semi-empirical drag coefficient to define the OF drag coefficients without the influence of the angles of attack (Formula presented.) of the wings; (ii) adjustment of the OF drag coefficients using AquaSim (AS) with its twine-by-twine drag correlation for various (Formula presented.) ; (iii) re-adjustment of the OF drag coefficients from two-dimensional CFD simulations using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) for a twine-by-twine establishment of a drag correlation on a 1 m plane net, highlighting the shielding effects for (Formula presented.). Consequently, an initial underestimation of −3% in the combined towline tension, for a nominal span ((Formula presented.)), was corrected to a slight overestimation of +7% compared to the GPGP data. For a wide span ((Formula presented.)), the deviation remained between +1% and +15% throughout the validation process. For a narrow span ((Formula presented.) 0.02), mostly exhibiting low (Formula presented.), the first cycle showed a +276% deviation, whereas at the end of the third cycle, it showed a +43% deviation. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {With decades of development, some offshore facilities are reaching their design lives and need to be decommissioned. However, due to the limitation of regulations, technologies, and other aspects, which decommissioning options should be chosen is a challenging task. This paper introduces a multi-attribute quantitative evaluation system called MADM-Q (Multi-Attribute Decision Making-Quantitative), which can show decision makers with decommissioning options’ cost, risk, and environmental impact assessment results. The system consists of an input, output, and three processing modules. The Engineering Cost Evaluation System (ECES) is the first bottom-up approach cost assessment model in offshore facility decommissioning research. The Hierarchical Analyst Domino Evaluation System (HADES) acts as the risk assessment module, considering Domino Effect Accidents (DEAs) and providing accurate and rapid quantitative risk assessment results. The third sub-model, Composite Impact Evaluation System (CIES) assesses the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the project. The system can obtain the basic cost range and the Individual Risk Per Annum (IRPA) value of the project quickly by using some simple inputs. The results of ECES and HADES reflects excellent accuracy - 12% cost evaluation average deviation and 1.43E-04 IRPA evaluation bias. Although currently, the HADES is a quasi-dynamic risk assessment method, it would be easy to develop it into a real-time dynamic risk monitoring and assessment system by combining advanced technologies such as digital twin technology and sensor technology. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Optimizing wells and remote compressors for operations can be time-consuming and hard work. Engineers and operation team struggle to uncover system bottlenecks and modify operating parameters. To automate the traditional optimization procedure, a novel data analytics workflow was applied alongside compressor simulation data. In this research, an innovative framework for optimizing facilities equipment has been adopted in this project to increase the value of assets via increased productivity. The results of thousands of compressor simulation runs have been exported to a training database. The system's operational data in real-time has been mapped to simulation findings using a data science model. Optimization workflow for different kinds of problems has been speculated up and made. This process is integrated using cloud service and machine learning deployment environment to generate a database of recommendations. The bottlenecks in the system are then visualized using an interactive dashboard, which acts to eliminate the bottlenecks during normal system operation. With an R2 greater than 0.99, the data science model matches the simulation findings well. After a few sessions of brainstorming with specialists, the optimization method covers practically all operational restrictions. This environment is being used to deliver daily analysis and recommendations to the operations and engineering teams. With the new framework, the traditional well and compressor optimization process has been transformed to a cutting-edge digital solution. The time required to locate wells and compressor bottlenecks has been significantly reduced. Opportunities that were previously not visible owing to inadequate time for workers to look at in the old approach have now been captured, and offshore adjustments have been completed much quicker than the prior approach. As a consequence, this initiative has the potential to provide large productivity gains. Furthermore, the analytical findings will serve as the basis for following facility optimization. Problems with wells and compressor packages will be identified as system constraints and used as input characteristics to anticipate downstream equipment failure or analyze troublesome wells to choke down. This project will provide a data foundation for other topside facilities in the future. In summary, this study has pioneered a new, automated approach by bringing together operation, machinery domain, and data science experts, which allows for delivery of effective bottleneck identification and recommendation to enhance well and compressor performance. In the future, this will serve as the basis for an automated workflow and a digital twin of the facilities, both of which will improve the oil and gas industry's ability to manage the efficiency of its wells and compressors.

	abstract = {The spatiotemporal flow field in a wind farm determines the wind turbines’ energy production and structural fatigue. However, it is not obtainable by the current measurement, modeling, and prediction tools in wind industry. Here we propose a novel data and knowledge fusion approach to create the first digital twin for onshore/offshore wind farm flow system, which can predict the in situ spatiotemporal wind field covering the entire wind farm. The digital twin is developed by integrating the Lidar measurements, the Navier–Stokes equations, and the turbine modeling using actuator disk method, via physics-informed neural networks. The design enables the seamless integration of Lidar measurements and turbine operating data for real-time flow characterization, and the fusion of flow physics for retrieving unmeasured wind field information. It thus addresses the limitations of existing wind prediction approaches based on supervised machine learning, which cannot achieve such prediction because the training targets are not available. Case studies of a wind farm under typical operating scenarios (i.e. a greedy case, a wake-steering case, and a partially-operating case) are carried out using high-fidelity numerical experiments, and the results show that the developed digital twin achieves very accurate mirroring of the physical wind farm, capturing detailed flow features such as wake interaction and wake meandering. The prediction error for the flow fields, on average, is just 4.7% of the value range. With the accurate flow field information predicted, the digital twin is expected to enable brand new research across wind farm lifecycle including monitoring, control, and load assessment. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Over the last decades, anticipating on the global increase in energy demand, necessary developments on the seabed have taken place that interfered with ocean ecosystems and related biodiversity enhancement capacities. As the awareness of this problem nowadays grows - as well as the efforts of large scale ecosystem restoration - the need for a reliable solution targeting the core of the problem does so as well: insufficient availability of environmental information to support decision making systems. By introducing AI-driven ecosystem insights, the nature inclusive scope on projects can be broadened and decision making as well as environmental requirements within the marine industry can be brought to a higher level. In working towards biodiversity enhancement at scale, creating a Digital Twin of the project site can give direction for decision making. This interactive digital blueprint offers valuable insights into the physical assets and the potential of integrating state-of-the-art biodiversity solutions. Following from our experience, we know that the protection and restoration of seaweed, oyster and mussel reefs, seagrass, coral and mangroves can significantly increase the ecosystem services they deliver. The Digital Twin will relate ecosystem services with economic indicators and show amongst others; the potential biodiversity increase, CO2 sequestration, oxygen level increase and corresponding revenues. It can track the impact and continuously demonstrate progress and status by integrating 3rd party monitoring and data collection methods. Worldwide offshore energy systems develop more and more towards multi-use, which is key to enhancing seabed biodiversity. The opportunities for multi-use are endless, but the inclusion of ecosystem restoration can only be successful if the right data is collected and insights can be shown. If we can better understand the system in which the intervention is taking place, we can better make the right decisions. An intelligent tool to create high traction and impact on marine ecosystems at scale, as it facilitates energy companies and operators to evaluate targeted and high-value environmental solutions. It will break down the complex challenge of biodiversity, and allows for easy and impactful decision-making on this topic. This will release pressure on specific species, and nature in general, and will allow them to thrive again. Efforts to enhance ecosystem services, combined with AI-driven insights, unleash a new sea of opportunities for nature inclusive works. Currently under development in collaboration with universities and research institutes, our aim with this paper is to inspire and invite marine industry partners to join our upscaling efforts. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

	abstract = {Open hole packers setting usually is performed running in hole the completion equipment and afterwards running a wireline operation to precisely check the packer position and make the needed adjustments to set it in accordance with the geological targets. The current digital twin software incorporates comprehensive models and it receives surface data in real time to analyze the current operation status, by comparing real and calculated (expected) data, with quantitative criteria. It allows the user to follow up the completion column running in hole, to make real time editions if any item needs to be replaced during operation (impact damage, measurement update, etc.). Torque and drag models allow to infer the completion column elongation and verify the real elements position within the well and based on integrity assessment the work window is calculated real time. The target depths are defined during drilling operations using logging data, then drill string elongation calculated with the drilling digital twin software was used to align the real reference depth in both scenarios, drilling and completion. With the real position of the packer in hole it was possible to define the stick up needed to adjust its position to the target depth before setting it. A validation was performed using three offshore real cases, where the packer position considering completion column elongation and the wireline results for packer position considering the pipe tag position detection were compared. In both approaches, a measurement for stick up was obtained to define the correct depth for packer setting and considered to be in good agreement. The novelty is the usage of numerical simulation to optimize the time spent to conclude the packer setting by avoiding an extra operation at the rig site, saving time, costs and operational risks. © Copyright 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {As one of the most promising clean energy sources, offshore wind farms (OWFs) have developed rapidly in countries around the world. However, due to complex weather and geological environments and increasing distance from the shore, operations and maintenance (O&M) costs of OWFs are much higher than those of other clean energy sources, accounting for as much as 30% of total life-cycle costs. Issues such as OWFs system reliability, O&M operator safety and ecological protection issues also become more and more prominent. To address these challenges, this paper reviews the latest research progress on digital twin (DT) technology targeting on OWFs O&M, including failure analysis, O&M objectives, strategies & optimization models, DT technology development, as well as DT-based O&M management and optimization. A DT-based O&M optimization framework is proposed which helps to improve the intelligence level of O&M. Computation of the value of a DT model is discussed and value-informed DT model development is proposed. Promising research areas on O&M optimization are identified. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Leaks may occur in existing pipelines, even when designed with quality construction and appropriate regulations. The economic impact of oil spills and natural gas dispersion from leaks can be huge. Failure to detect pipeline leaks promptly will have an adverse impact on life, the economy, the environment, and corporate reputation. Therefore, early detection of leaks, their location, and their size with high sensitivity and reliability are important for efficient hydrocarbon transportation through a pipeline, both in onshore and offshore applications. Although several studies have been conducted on leak detection using various techniques, recent literature that comprehensively investigates and summarizes the different multiphase leak detection techniques could not be found. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the different leak detection techniques in pipelines, wellbores, and subsurface sequestration wells. This is done by studying the different multiphase flow leak detection techniques using various Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Mechanistic, Machine Learning models, and digital twin techniques in the pipeline as well as in sub-surface sequestration sites. A comprehensive investigation revealed that a few studies have been conducted related to integrated multiphase flow leak experiments, computational fluid dynamics, mechanistic models, and implementing extended real-time transient monitoring using machine learning. This type of systematic investigation is deemed to be more useful for field applications. Furthermore, a new set of recommendations is provided in the last section which shows how experimental, mechanistic, and CFD simulation data can be used to drive a statistical approach based on modern deep learning and digital twin techniques. This allows for the precise understanding of the leak events such as size, location, and orientation of the leak, without sending a remotely operated underwater vehicle or aircraft to scan the whole pipeline and ocean. © 2024 The Authors},

One of the most attractive aspects is the concept of digital twins, which refers to digital replicas of physical assets, processes, and systems that can be used as advanced tools for design, operation, and maintenance. This article introduces the development of the digital twin of the research vessel (RV) Gunnerus in Norway, which will be a significant scientific and operational achievement for the maritime industry, making efficient and safe offshore operations possible. It enables data exchange safely and easily among different subsystems, modules, and various applications. Thus, the twin ship can provide an integrated view of the ship's various physical and behavioral aspects in different stages and allow simultaneous optimization of functional performance requirements. In addition, it enables advanced control and optimization, e.g., creating more reliable prediction for flexible objectives (time, output, emissions, fuel consumption), and executing day-Ahead and long-Term planning for operations. Several related applications are presented in the end to confirm the effectiveness of the digital twin ship system. © 1994-2011 IEEE.},

The large amounts of the ballast are modeled in the finite element model to enhance the accuracy of the digital twin. Considering the influence of environmental factors such as tide level and wave direction, the added mass effect of structural members, one of the hydrodynamic effects, depending on the change of the ocean environments is calculated based on the rule of Det Norske Veritas and applied. The results indicate that non-structural mass components significantly impact the dynamic characteristics of the structure.

	abstract = {The main objective in this work was to develop and test automated pore pressure and wellbore stability predictions ahead of bit using a digital twin. The new automated real-time workflow, with three smart agents for pore pressure, mudweight and well pressure was tested on historical data and real-time drilling campaigns for one exploration well and several production wells in the North Sea and offshore Mid-Norway. A digital workflow is set up from pre-drill 3D basin scale pore pressure modelling using a stochastic MonteCarlo approach, including an automated update of pressure prognosis while drilling using sonic or resistivity data. Additionally, the innovative approach will also reduce the uncertainty in the predicted mud-weight window ahead of the bit. Three new smart agents have been implemented in a real-time data platform for drilling; one for pore pressure prediction, one for mudweight real-time calculations and one for well pressure real-time predictions. The new automated workflow has been tested on several wells, either in real-time, or on historical data as playback. Both pressure real-time updates using sonic log (for exploration well) and resistivity data (for production well) have been tested with very good results, especially when filters on the raw log data are used, removing artefacts in input data, effect of well inclinations, lithologies etc. In addition, the real-time Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD) prediction has been compared with downhole ECD measurements. Digital twin using playback data from a well, offshore Mid-Norway has been carried out with automated correction and smoothing of the calculated pore pressure from resistivity log. The new automated workflow will contribute to increase the efficiency of drilling operations subject to narrow pressure margins and uncertain reservoir pressure, by providing a quantitative and adaptive automated workflow to support the drillers/rig crews. The new automated workflow is presented for both exploration and production wells and the workflow can contribute to more cost effective and safer operations. The methodology can in the future be combined with machine learning.  Copyright © 2024, IADC/SPE International Drilling Conference and Exhibition.},

	abstract = {An integrated structural monitoring system (ISMS) for offshore platforms composed of different monitoring networks working simultaneously is presented in this contribution. The sensor networks of the proposed solution allow for covering both global and local key monitoring tasks, and a comprehensive knowledge of structural situation is ensured. It is possible to get precise information on environmental excitations and to measure their effect on the structure. Moreover, a thorough alarm service allows for efficient notification of possible critical situations both in real time and in the long term. Main outcomes obtained from first monitoring experiences on offshore platforms performed over more than five years are presented and explained in detail. The outcomes of the ISMS may represent a valuable input for a wide range of strategic tasks, such as asset integrity control, model update, digital twin. Different key activities related to the asset management can take advantage from the installation of the ISMS, especially in case of aged structures, such as life extension certification, relaxation of periodicity of inspections, energy transition projects.

The trained model acts as a digital twin of the ship's behavior with respect to sloshing. By estimating sloshing activity based on real ship conditions, rather than relying on conservative assumptions, more accurate risk monitoring is possible, enabling actions to avoid sloshing or plan tank maintenance at the most appropriate time. © 2023 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).},

	abstract = {SPE's Drilling Systems Automation Technical Section (DSATS) sponsors the Drillbotics® autonomous drilling contest to promote advanced learning at participating universities. Two groups working independently employed similar engineering, software, and control technology to detect and mitigate drilling dysfunctions. Both teams demonstrated understanding of engineering requirements coupled with hands-on experience to successfully deploy their designs. One team created a control model that connected with an industry research entity's well model that included a variety of formations and downhole pressures based on data from previously drilled wells in the North Sea. The well control simulation was new to the competition, and the team successfully created a workable system. The team drilled ahead at optimal ROP, stopping for connections. They then had to recognize an influx and determine whether this should be handled with the MPD system or stop drilling and close in on the kick. The model monitored surface flow in and flow out and pit level and compared readings with a trend analysis based on one-second data. The kick detection module included a technique to minimize false positives using a higher kick threshold, first giving a warning, and then switching from conventional drilling to MPD, and finally closing in the well if necessary. The simulated kick occurred during a connection and was a small kick at a low influx rate. It was detected when drilling, but later than desired. A retest with a lower kick threshold was more successful. A second team designed and built a remotely operated autonomous small scale experimental rig that included a working version of an RSS tool to steer the BHA along a predefined trajectory within a block of sandstone. The control architecture enabled the distribution of various drilling tasks to independent specialized operating algorithms. Despite the limitations of a 1.5-inch wellbore, the physical rig team constructed and implemented an RSS with three pads actuated mechanically from the surface. Accompanied by an enhanced bit design and a length reduction of the BHA by over 50% compared to the previous model, a build rate of 8 degrees was achieved in less than two feet measured depth. This effort resulted in the team's first successful application of the newly developed scaled RSS to autonomously drill a directional trajectory provided only minutes earlier. An externally applied electromagnetic field was used to measure the azimuth, while an accelerometer was used to measure the inclination to close the feedback loop for the steering algorithm. Both teams had to solve common engineering problems, which may lead to the use of a physical rig to improve the fidelity of virtual models. Importantly, there is an increasing industry need to provide improved data interoperability, which is being met by this program. The achievements of both teams are important to the future of drilling automation, as they are first steps towards using these research tools to improve the creation of digital twins of full-scale rigs and to verify and validate interoperability of third-party apps prior to field release on land and offshore rigs.

	abstract = {Digital twins, replicating the physical assets they represent and working safely, effectively, and efficiently, can provide trustworthy results within well-defined limits and to a stated level of confidence. Capability and trustworthiness over time requires assurance processes and a methodology to assess and qualify the digital twin solutions. The purpose of a continuous assurance process is to ensure that the capabilities remain valid over time. A standard (DNV-RP-A204, 2023) for the qualification and assurance of digital twins has been developed and released recently. The framework in this standard was developed in close cooperation with the industry, including offshore floating and subsea facilities operators, and is currently being used across the energy sector by both technology vendors, engineering companies and operators. The ability to execute a specified action or achieve a specified outcome, based on real time situational awareness and decision support, will define the capability level of the digital twin, moving from descriptive to predictive to automated. Digital twins are becoming more data-driven and digitalized and should be prepared for automated decision making. The framework presented within the standard (DNV-RP-A204, 2023) addresses requirements to the functionality, technology integration, operations, the digital twin platform, including data quality and cyber security aspects, and requirements to the organization developing and operating digital twins. For each of these areas, clearly defined working and quality assurance processes and requirements have been defined and described. Keeping a digital twin trustworthy and valid over time is a key challenge. The digital twin solutions need to be identified and managed as a key system, integrated in existing work processes, subjected to management of change processes, and continuously updated to accurately represent the physical asset at any time. All stakeholders need to implement tools and processes to monitor, assess and manage all relevant changes, which shall be verified. This paper presents the philosophy and framework of the methodology from DNV-RP-A204 in the context of developing and operating a digital asset, as well as learnings from completed and ongoing projects. © Copyright 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

A high-fidelity viscous-flow solver, based on solving the Navier–Stokes equations for the free surface flow and implicitly coupled resolution of rigid body nonlinear motions and mooring dynamics, is employed to generate the ground truth. The data-driven model is trained using wave elevations as inputs and computed hydrodynamic motions and loads as outputs. We assess the effectiveness of the data-driven framework for modelling wave–structure interactions in both regular and irregular waves, demonstrating accurate predictions of hydrodynamic motions and loads in nonlinear waves with varying wavelengths and steepness. Leveraging the long short-term memory network, our surrogate model offers substantial computational savings for complex physical models and has the potential to create a digital twin of real offshore structures, ensuring operability and safety in various nonlinear sea states. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {[Introduction] Speeding up the offshore wind power construction and development is of great significance to promoting the adjustment of China's energy structure. China is accelerating the process of its wind power development in the entire offshore area, and the geological survey is a vital foundation and key technology of offshore wind power development. [Method] By studying the marine geological survey technologies at home and abroad and combining years of experience in different sea areas, this paper proposed a new technology of engineering geological modeling for offshore wind power development based on the principle of consistency. Firstly, the survey equipment selection and survey line layout started from a three-dimensional initial model to evaluate the impact of geological changes and geohazards on the offshore wind power engineering construction and took into full account the ship selection, field in situ and laboratory tests, and correlation of geophysical prospecting and geotechnical data. Then, with abundant and continuous data obtained from the boreholes and the whole wind farm during the feasibility study and detailed survey, the methods of combination of indoor geotechnical tests with the in-situ tests, the combination of multiple geophysical prospecting devices and the combination of geotechnical and geophysical prospecting methods were used to conduct a consistency analysis of various data, manage the geological survey data platform, update the model and build the final model, and the engineering geological model was continuously optimized and iterated in the subsequent stages. The engineering geological model provided comprehensive engineering geological information for the entire life cycle of offshore wind farm design, installation, operation, maintenance and decommissioning. [Result] The research results and offshore wind power geological survey examples show that by conducting consistent comprehensive layout and data analysis, effectively connecting geotechnical investigation with engineering geophysical prospecting and constructing a three-dimensional crossing engineering geological model, it can effectively solve the problem of "ambiguities of geological survey data" and improve the reliability, accuracy and application of geological survey data. [Conclusion] The new method proposed is one of the effective methods to reduce cost and increase efficiency in offshore engineering as well as the embryonic form of digital twin of offshore wind power geological survey and the foundation for the construction of a geological survey big data base. © 2023 Energy Observer Magazine Co., Ltd..

	abstract = {Open access to harmonised digital data describing Earth's surface and subsurface holds immense value for society. This paper highlights the significance of open access to digital geoscience data ranging from the shallow topsoil or seabed to depths of 5 km. Such data play a pivotal role in facilitating endeavours such as renewable geoenergy solutions, resilient urban planning, supply of critical raw materials, assessment and protection of water resources, mitigation of floods and droughts, identification of suitable locations for carbon capture and storage, development of offshore wind farms, disaster risk reduction, and conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity. EuroGeoSurveys, the Geological Surveys of Europe, have worked diligently for over a decade to ensure open access to harmonised digital European geoscience data and knowledge through the European Geological Data Infrastructure (EGDI). EGDI acts as a data and information resource for providing wide-ranging geoscience data and research, as this paper demonstrates through selected research data and information on four vital natural resources: geoenergy, critical raw materials, water, and soils. Importantly, it incorporates near real-time remote and in-situ monitoring data, thus constituting an invaluable up-to-date database that facilitates informed decision-making, policy implementation, sustainable resource management, the green transition, achieving UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the envisioned future of digital twins in Earth sciences. EGDI and its thematic map viewer are tailored, continuously enhanced, and developed in collaboration with all relevant researchers and stakeholders. Its primary objective is to address societal needs by providing data for sustainable, secure, and integrated management of surface and subsurface resources, effectively establishing a geological service for Europe. We argue that open access to surface and subsurface geoscience data is crucial for an efficient green transition to a net-zero society, enabling integrated and coherent surface and subsurface spatial planning. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {This work presents a cloud-based Virtual Flow Metering (VFM) system powered by a hybrid physics-data approach to estimate the water production per well in a gas field. This hybrid approach, which allows accurate calculations near real-time conditions, is based on the description of the flow through the wellbore using physics-based models pertaining to gas-liquid flows with high gas volume fraction. A data-driven approach is implemented to tune the flow model using well test data. This implementation accounts for changes in the well performance and increase in water production, resulting in a self-calibrating solution. This means that the model will remain accurate and relevant as production and well conditions change. Results from the VFM show good agreement with the well test data for steady-state conditions. The VFM calculations are performed remotely using a cloud-based DataOps platform where results are also stored. This allows continuous access to live sensor data to be used as input to other applications or visualized through a web interface. The VFM system uses a set of readily available sensors installed in the wells. Thus, it represents cost reduction in both capital and operating expenditures when compared to the installation of multiphase flow meters or separators. © 2023 Cognite AS},

	abstract = {The uncertainty of geological composition, the invisibility of the under-well real-time working conditions, and the complexity of the engineering simulation in the oil and gas field drilling and production process have hindered its scientific and efficient design and construction. The digital twin technology can bring up real-time, intelligent, and visualized project design and decision-making but has yet to lack a systematic method for modeling oil and gas field drilling and production. In this regard, the article first explored the current levels of investigation and implementation both domestically and abroad, based on that the level of development by applying the maturity index was quantified. It then proposed the digital twin modeling approach for drilling and production in the oil and gas field, which encompassed the modeling workflow, model division strategies, architecture for model assembly and integration, and modeling tools for constructing the digital twin. Also, two case were studied for drilling and production, using wellbore stability while drilling and offshore gas well production system as two examples, respectively. Finally, the difficulties and challenges related to the digital twin deployment in the field were analyzed, based on which the suggestions for its future development are proposed. It is found that the digital twin for drilling and production has stayed at the visualization level and at a relatively low degree of maturity compared to the manufacturing field on digital twin. The complex demand for oil and gas drilling and production systems can be divided into several clear and easy realized sub-demands. Based on requirement analysis, the modeled object can be separated to be various sub-models based on the granularity, dimension, and lifecycle. The sub-models are then assembled layer by layer across the model, function, and demand layers so that the multi-dimension and multi-field models can be integrated. Meanwhile, an improvement of their methods and an increase in efficiency for the model administration, data management, and engineering simulation ae desired. Moreover, the digital twin faces the problems such as difficulty in selection and fusion of multi-source heterogeneous data, vagueness in the sub-model definition, and ambiguity in the model validation, as well as the challenges such as the complicated kinetics processes, multi-division and multi-task collaboration, and development of domestic software tools. In summary, the digital twin modeling approach and the case studies in this article can provide a methodological guidance and practical reference for oil and gas drilling and production practices. © 2024 Tsinghua University Press.

	abstract = {The utilization of neural operators in a digital twin model of an offshore floating structure holds the potential for a significant shift in the prediction of structural responses and health monitoring, offering valuable real-time control insights. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of three neural operators, namely the deep operator network (DeepONet), the Fourier neural operator (FNO), and the Wavelet neural operator (WNO), to accurately capture the responses of a floating structure under six different sea state codes (3−8) based on the wave characteristics described by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). To further enhance the accuracy of the vanilla architecture of the neural operators, novel extensions, such as wavelet-DeepONet and self-adaptive WNO, are proposed in this paper. The results demonstrate that these high-precision neural operators can deliver structural responses more efficiently, up to two orders of magnitude faster than a dynamic analysis using conventional numerical solvers. Additionally, compared to gated recurrent units (GRUs), a commonly used recurrent neural network for time-series estimation, neural operators are both more accurate and efficient, especially in situations with limited data availability. Taken together, our study shows that FNO outperforms all other operators for approximating the mapping of one input functional space to the output space as well as for responses that have small bandwidth of the frequency spectrum. Conversely, DeepONet, with historical states, proves most accurate in learning the mapping of multiple input functions to the output space and capturing responses within a broad frequency spectrum. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Wind energy has gradually become one of the most efficient and reliable forms of sustainable energy, and it is being globally utilized to accelerate the expansion of green power production. However, recent projections of onshore & offshore wind energy systems indicate that further improvements are continuously required in terms of the deployments, capacity factors, costs, etc. to achieve an optimal wind power generation. According to these projections, the most critical current issue is the offshore systems' high levelized cost of energy, which demands the enhancements of the technologies to ensure the cost reduction in the future. Moreover, a number of reports are underscoring that offshore power systems can also leave a larger carbon footprints through their life-cycles compared to the onshore counterpart. On the other hand, the modelling methods of the power plants' life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) have nowadays become among the most compelling research problems in the field of wind power systems engineering. In addition to comparatively assessing the characteristics of onshore & offshore energy systems based on some reports & studies, this work is therefore aimed at rigorously exploring the existing study practices in modelling the wind power plants' LCIA. A number of these practices were based on the implementation of various conventional modelling methods that may not help to make accurate assessments of the wind power plants’ life-cycle impacts. Hence, one of the main contributions of this study is to summarize a novel LCIA modelling approach based on Internet of Things (IoT) and predictive digital twin technologies. Unlike the conventional methods, real-time data extraction from the power plants makes these technologies possible to conduct the most accurate assessments of the life-cycle impacts. © 2023 The Authors},

However, there is still a shortage of research in this area. This paper proposes a general multi-level predictive maintenance decision-making framework driven by digital twin, considering component dependencies, the variable time scale of decisions, and comprehensive maintenance resources, in which an optimal maintenance schedule can be obtained in real time and then fed back to the physical space, so as to realize closed-loop control. A maintenance decision-making optimization model is then formulated based on integer linear programming to minimize total maintenance costs while meeting required production capacity. Further, a novel matheuristics algorithm (i.e., the interoperation of metaheuristics and mathematical programming techniques) is introduced for various maintenance decision scenarios. Finally, a case study of an offshore oil and gas production system consisting of eight subsea Christmas trees is examined, and the effects of changes in production capacity, failure thresholds, and maintenance resources on the multi-level optimization of decision-making solutions are discussed. © 2023 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

The DMD efficiently simplifies complex fluid systems while retaining key dynamics, thus significantly saving computational costs. By leveraging its combined strengths, the CNN-LSTM with an attention mechanism effectively captures complex spatiotemporal features. The resulting ROM accurately reproduces the wake processes around a cylinder (group), demonstrating high consistency with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solutions (coefficient of determination > 0.98), and showcases satisfactory resilience to a (Gaussian) noise level of up to 25 %. This study contributes a robust ROM capable of handling spatiotemporal dynamics, facilitating swift prediction of future outcomes using historical data, which is particularly critical for efficient real-time analysis and informed decision-making in dynamic settings, e.g., digital twins and predictive maintenance. © 2024},

We propose combining systems engineering methods and digital twin technology to enable system concept and execution aiming at value robustness. The system is modeled in mission, subsystems, components, and design attributes. System utilities and costs are estimated for a range of viable solutions based on the relevance of each attribute to the stakeholders. The alternatives are evaluated using the Epoch-Era Analysis framework for analyzing the system's performance over time in changing future scenarios. The system model also outlines a digital twin concept and identifies how it might support salt cave design and operations.

	abstract = {Aging ships and offshore structures face harsh environmental and operational conditions in remote areas, leading to age-related damages such as corrosion wastage, fatigue cracking, and mechanical denting. These deteriorations, if left unattended, can escalate into catastrophic failures, causing casualties, property damage, and marine pollution. Hence, ensuring the safety and integrity of aging ships and offshore structures is paramount and achievable through innovative healthcare schemes. One such paradigm, digital healthcare engineering (DHE), initially introduced by the final coauthor, aims at providing lifetime healthcare for engineered structures, infrastructure, and individuals (e.g., seafarers) by harnessing advancements in digitalization and communication technologies. The DHE framework comprises five interconnected modules: on-site health parameter monitoring, data transmission to analytics centers, data analytics, simulation and visualization via digital twins, artificial intelligence-driven diagnosis and remedial planning using machine and deep learning, and predictive health condition analysis for future maintenance. This article surveys recent technological advancements pertinent to each DHE module, with a focus on its application to aging ships and offshore structures. The primary objectives include identifying cost-effective and accurate techniques to establish a DHE system for lifetime healthcare of aging ships and offshore structures - a project currently in progress by the authors.  © The Author(s), 2024.

	abstract = {The subsea production system is essential for the subsea production of oil and gas. Real-time monitoring can ensure safe production. The subsea production control system is the core of the subsea production system and the top priority to be monitored. Troubleshooting the subsea production system involves lifting the component to the platform to repair it. And then send it back subsea. There is no doubt that it is expensive. In this case, some faults will not be handled temporarily if they do not affect the system operation seriously. This leads to multiple faults existing simultaneously, resulting in mixed signals. That makes it difficult to distinguish the state of the subsea production system. Thus, a fault diagnosis method for composite faults is needed. A digital twin-driven fault diagnosis method for composite faults is proposed by combining virtual and real data. Bernoulli Equation combines loss, control, and state parameters to build a digital twin model. A cross-validation enhanced fault diagnosis method is applied to single faults. A Bayesian network-based fault diagnosis model combining virtual and real data is built for composite faults. Field data from an offshore platform in the South Sea of China is used to demonstrate the effect of the proposed method. The results indicate that the method is extremely effective for composite faults of the subsea production control system. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Natural gas explosion of offshore platform is prone to cause accidental disaster such as platform collapse and casualties etc. Real-time natural gas explosion consequence reconstruction is essential to support a quick accidental emergency response planning to prevent the accidental escalation to disaster. The widely-used CFD is computationally intensive and thereby has a significant delay. Machine/deep learning-based models offer a potential real-time alternative, which however are not able to quantify the uncertainty of spatial overpressure prediction. This study aims to propose a hybrid deep learning probability model to real-time predict spatial explosion overpressure of offshore platform by using sparsely-observed overpressures. In this hybrid model, Variational Bayesian inference is incorporated into deep learning backbone. Both natural gas explosion experimental and numerical modeling of offshore platform are conducted to construct the benchmark dataset. By using this benchmark dataset, sensitivity analysis of Monte Carlo sampling number N, drop probability p on model's performance is also conducted. The results demonstrated our model exhibits high accuracy with R2 = 0.955 and real-time capability with inference time of 2.9s. Compared to the state-of-the-art model, the additional uncertainty estimation improves the accuracy and robustness of spatial overpressure prediction, which contributes to the reliable explosion accidental emergency decision-making. Overall, this study provides a reliable alternative for constructing digital twin emergency management system to effectively manage natural gas explosion risk of offshore platforms. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

One strong limitation that restrains the use of the method is the difficulty in selecting the appropriate data when a large variety of records come from several providers. Domain ontologies can organize and offer a uniform view for data analysis without plastering the data in a rigid format. This work describes an innovative visualization platform for data analysis of petroleum production time series that allows the user to explore the semantics of the oil well data with the support of a well-founded domain ontology. The O3PO ontology represents a production plant's installation assets, describing the equipment's relevant properties, such as position, relationship with other assets, and sensor measurements. The visualization platform takes advantage of the ontology to assist the user in locating the installation component, equipment, and collected measurements, bringing the time series data to the analytic tool for analysis by various groups. The ontology provides a taxonomy for navigating between classes and subsequently selecting instances, components, and properties. We describe the use of the visualization tool in real-case data from an offshore oilfield in Brazilian Pre-salt.

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to deploy an autonomous real-time Digital Twin (DT) Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system on offshore platform to enable continuous real-time monitoring and automated evaluation of the structural integrity based on the offshore feeding data of a 4-legged fixed substructure which has experienced vessel collision earlier. The collaboration between asset owners, asset operators, and academic researchers aimed to develop an advanced DT SHM system for this purpose. The SHM system implemented a comprehensive framework that integrated software and hardware components with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities. The hardware facilitated the collection of raw data, while a proprietary physics engine was developed to enable autonomous structural analysis for calibration and subsequent integrity assessment to identify the most probable source of structural anomalies. Real-time data acquired online were used to derive useful structural engineering parameters, forming a digital twin that emulated the actual offshore condition of the structure. The deployment of the autonomous SHM system provided asset operators with valuable insights into the structural performance of the substructure in real-time. This enabled fast decision-making aiming to improve the efficiency of engineering manhours as well as optimisation of inspection and maintenance practices. The system outperformed conventional methods by timely quantifying the influence of assessed damages on the global substructural integrity, allowing for more accurate benchmarking and up-to-date information. This case study emphasizes the significance of adopting autonomous Digital Twin SHM systems for offshore structures, particularly when compared to manual assessments. The implementation of the autonomous system reduces both time and effort while providing reliable benchmarking and up-to-date information on the structural integrity of the monitored structure. This highlights the importance of utilizing advanced SHM technologies to optimise the inspection and maintenance practices of offshore structures. The objective of this paper is to present the framework for a Digital Twin SHM system that is designed for real-time global structural monitoring.

	abstract = {Based on the current applications in the oil and gas industry, this paper approaches the main challenges in the development of a Digital Twin for subsea production system assets. Bibliographical research was carried out to select relevant digital twin solutions developed in the different sectors of the oil and gas industry, in order to identify the main challenges, risks and prospects for implementing this type of technology. Furthermore, this manuscript also provides solutions developed by the authors based on the experiences in research, development and innovation of national projects for digital transformation. These solutions contemplate data analysis, connections with databases, definitions of recurrent degradation models in the oil and gas industry. A digital twin can be defined as the digital representation of a system or asset, which calculates states and provides relevant information through integrated models and data, to support decisions throughout the life cycle. In the upstream, whose main activities involve the exploration and production of oil and gas, digital twin can be used as a tool for asset integrity management in the production system and associated with integrity management methodologies such as Risk Based Inspection (RBI). The implementation of a digital twin is a complex task and has several challenges, since it is composed of many models and data that need to be interconnected. However, it is common for data from different sources to be stored on different systems. Another relevant challenge concerns the models associated with digital twins, which are sources of uncertainties. The lack of consistent models and coordination between current physical and virtual models, complex data validation, collection and processing challenges are obstacles in implementing a digital twin. If well implemented, the digital twin can help in the decision-making process related to asset integrity management by following the asset throughout its life cycle. In an RBI approach, it can reduce the OPEX cost of subsea systems. This paper will approach the stages of the development of a digital twin for subsea production systems assets and the main challenges based on recent studies carried out in the oil and gas industry such as the requirement for transparency in data exchange while maintaining security and confidentiality, data-model assimilation, uncertainty and validation of models. In addition, it will be presented the experience acquired by the authors in the development of solutions for integrity management. © Copyright 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {In this paper we describe the Fenja Digital-Twin solution, its automated advisory workflow, and how it enhances operational excellence and further strengthens the operational health, safety, and environment (HSE) vision of Neptune Energy. The Fenja development is a subsea tieback to the Njord-A platform located in the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Fenja wax and hydrate management strategies are based on active heating of the world's longest electrically traced heated pipe-in-pipe (ETH PIP) as the primary layer of protection. The Fenja development demands a reliable and robust solution to address flow assurance challenges and support operational activities planning (production management, shutdown, startup, virtual metering, hydrate/wax formation preventions, ETH pipeline operation, and chemical tracking). A digital twin solution deployed for the Fenja development uses the integrated power of machine learning and data analytics with multiphase flow simulation, enabling enhanced efficiency and transforming operations. The Keep-Warm and Warm-Up advisory workflows help reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the environment by optimizing the ETH pipeline power consumption and empowering the operational decision-making process for operations. Leak detection advisory (LDA) uses data analytics, signatures analysis, and pattern recognition to rapidly detect potential leaks of fluids from hydrocarbon pipeline. Combining digital twin with data analytics makes detecting leaks more precise and avoids false alarms. A faster and highly precise LDA advisory can potentially minimize a great deal of hydrocarbon loss to the environment in a real leak event. In the test environment for the factory acceptance test, the LDA was able to produce an alarm within 1 hour after the onset of a small leak (1% of pipe diameter) and within 15 minutes for a moderate (>3% of pipe diameter) to large leaks. A vast amount of real-time distributed temperature sensing data (at every 3-m distance, a total of 34,000 data points) along the entire length of the ETH pipeline and riser are continuously collected offshore and then fed into the advisory module. A customized automated workflow is developed to process this enormous amount of near real-time data to be used in calibration and to provide useful insights to the end user. New methods, using machine learning and data clustering techniques, are used to develop specific automated advisories. The digital twin with automated advisory runs automatically and needs minimal to no intervention, providing operational awareness and actionable insights to decision-makers in real time. The integration of a "replay" functionality to rerun historical actions performed in the field and "look-ahead" functionality for future predictions in a collaborative environment makes the Fenja Digital-Twin solution an essential tool for operations.

	abstract = {Irregular ocean waves cause fluctuating non-linear hydrodynamic forces on the body, which is an importance factor to account for in offshore and marine applications. While physical experimental and computational techniques provide valuable physics insight, they are generally time-consuming and expensive for design space exploration. We present an efficient Long Short Time Memory (LSTM) based deep-learning technique to predict unsteady hydrodynamic forces on slender bodies, where drag forces are more dominant than inertia forces. A leaky non-linear rectification is employed to approximate the mapping between surface elevation time series and hydrodynamic (drag) force time series. The deep neural network is fed with irregular waves based on JONSWAP spectrum as the input and the target data generated by the full-order Navier-Stokes computations using a generic offshore jack-up platform. The LSTM is trained using a stochastic gradient descent method to predict time series of the hydrodynamic forces on the jack-up and the results are compared with the full-order computations. Within the error threshold, the predictions based on our deep convolutional network have a speed-up of nearly 2 orders of magnitude compared to the full-order results and consume an insignificant fraction of computational resources. Overall, the proposed LSTM-based approximation procedure has the potential to be used for parametric design and digital twinning of jack-up platforms. Copyright © 2023 by ASME.},

	abstract = {This article aims to present the evolution of well design and well integrity monitoring throughout their life cycle and life extension analysis. The motivation comes from the need to make a decision to extend the life of wells, accounting both for Green and Brown Fields. PETROBRAS design practices were updated to meet the Well Integrity National Regulatory requirements and to support the life extension analysis. In order to assess the well integrity during production lifetime, a Digital Twin of the well was developed and is capable of modelling the physics of permanent and transient fluid flow and corresponding behavior of trapped annuli with thermo-structural coupling to the mechanical structure. Also, as part of the monitoring process, additional information will be provided by new sensors to be installed in the A and B annuli, aiming to improve monitoring capability. This paper will present the results of the new well design and life extension analysis practices for retrofit projects. Besides that, a discussion on new challenging scenarios faced by the company is included. The well integrity case study of a deep-water field in Brazilian offshore, through a real time digital twin approach, will highlight the main technological solutions developed to ensure well operation within the envelope during its lifetime. The adoption of this strategy allows the optimization of procedures with the goal of maximizing production or injection rates, still according to safety requirements. The availability of additional annuli sensors can improve the system capability. With the well integrity surveillance digital twin, PETROBRAS successfully implemented a unique monitoring integrity system for offshore production units in Brazil, increasing the understanding of the well structure behavior and, consequentially, the assets operational safety during its lifetime. In addition, this initiative aims to push the industry towards the development of wet X-mas tree according to API RP 17V requirements. © 2022, Offshore Technology Conference. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Model-based methods such as torque and drag, hydraulics, hole cleaning, and downhole dynamics have improved over the past years for pre-job design and post-analysis of drilling operations. However, there is a still a large gap in extending these traditionally manual processes and scaling them up for model-based, real-time decision support systems. Significant opportunities exist in applying these towards drilling hazard avoidance, performance diagnostics, and optimization. It is desirable to have an automated solution that orchestrates data ingestion and model calculations based on physics-based, data driven, or hybrid methods, to analyze real-time field data and enable valuable insights into operations. In this context, cognitive twins refer to the ability to deliver actionable insights for real-time optimization and hazard avoidance through systematic automation of data and model pipelines. In this work, a sustainable real-time solution is proposed comprising of data aggregation, cleansing, analytics, and cognitive twins to enable the automated orchestration, analysis, and insight delivery from drilling models. This process drives the scalability of the system - ensuring evergreen models and analysis are always available across all rigs and wells in a drilling fleet. Methods of modeling and analysis combine data driven methods with physics-based constraints to compute certain key quantities (e.g., friction factors, pressure deviations, and cuttings bed height). These quantities contain results and intermediate features which can be used for machine learning methods to drive fleet performance optimization above and beyond well-level analysis. We applied these methods to both onshore and offshore wells in real-time to identify and automatically detect several early warning signs of common drilling problems such as stuck pipe, washouts, and poor hole cleaning. Issues related to friction, hydraulics, cuttings transport, general drilling efficiency, and combinations of the previous categories are translated into actionable insights, which can be immediately implemented in the field to enhance safety, reduce non-productive time, and increase performance. In addition, the insights were also analyzed at a fleet-wide scale to identify patterns and drive operational best practices. Common challenges and solutions relating to implementing such a system at scale are addressed. This methodology addresses and overcomes many of the challenges involved in applying digital twins in a sustainable, real-time mode. It extends functionality into cognitive twins that can analyze modeled behavior to real-time results and enables automated insights to be generated for single models such as torque and drag in isolation and combinations of models such as the insights derived from interpreting torque and drag, hydraulics, and hole cleaning results simultaneously.

	abstract = {DeepOcean and partners have for multiple years been developing an Autonomous Inspection Drone (AID). This is a remotely operated vehicle designed to perform high-quality inspections of subsea assets. The AID is equipped with a state-of-the-art machine vision camera, which is used to autonomously navigate through a pre-programmed inspection scope. The operation of the AID is supervised by our remote operation center in Haugesund, Norway. This paper presents results from our first field trial. A digital twin was constructed for multiple subsea templates. The digital twin was developed into a game where a model of the AID was controlled. This allowed inspection engineers to plan the route for the inspection. The planned route in the digital twin was exported to the AID. The AID autonomously executed the planned route. Autonomous navigation was made possible by combining an inertial navigation system, a USBL positioning system and a machine vision camera. The machine vision camera detected QR-codes on the subsea asset. This allowed the AID to correct position and determine the true location on the asset. Multiple tests were performed during this field trial. Observations of these tests are presented in the paper. Examples of tests that were performed during the field trials include autonomous undocking and docking from TMS, executing of pre-programmed inspection route and station keeping when QR codes were detected on the subsea asset. It was observed in the field trials that the control system to the AID would need to be further developed. This is to increase the robustness and enhance the efficiency of autonomous navigation. These considerations are discussed in the paper, and conclusions are drawn with regard to how this may be achieved. This paper will explain how DeepOcean planned and executed an inspection scope by combining a digital twin of the asset and a machine vision camera used to assist the navigation of the AID. The results and conclusions presented from this field trial are essential for the petroleum industry to step into a future where resident vehicles are able to perform value-creating work autonomously. In the near term, this work is forming the foundation for DeepOcean to increase the performance of simultaneous operations from our vessels. This will be made possible as the AID may be launched from the vessel, which is completing some other intervention work, and come back after the autonomous inspection has been completed.

	abstract = {The concept of the digital twin can be thought of as a virtual representation of a physical product, engineering system or facility. This paper presents the role of predictive engineering analytics, alongside operating data, in the digital twin. Using case studies, the authors demonstrate how predictive approaches can be developed to provide data where it cannot be measured and predict future operating data to improve performance, life and integrity of equipment, systems and facilities. The digital twin is fundamentally based on data, larger datasets provide greater insight. Sensor and inspection data are critical. However, there are scenarios in which engineers require data where it cannot be measured or requires data that cannot be measured. Engineers require ways to extract this data, this can be done through predictive engineering analytics. Predictive engineering analytics, in the form of science-based simulations, combines multiple approaches, often based on fundamental principles of physics and engineering. This paper will demonstrate how high-fidelity approaches, such as Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), combined with system-level simulation and reduced-order modelling can work together with field data to provide this data in real-time. Two case studies presented show how combinations of different levels of science-based modelling approaches can help. A subsea thermal digital twin demonstrates how high-fidelity simulations, undertaken during system design, can be the foundation for reduced order system models capable of capturing critical thermal performance in real time; aiding hydrate risk management during operation. The methods used to train the real-time predictive approach are demonstrated. The second case presented focuses on structural integrity of a heat exchanger showing how real-time sensor data can be translated into structural integrity data and insight through simulation. The cases presented demonstrate the value of science-based predictions to generate data that cannot be obtained from operational sensor data alone. The authors aim to show how the predictive element of the digital twin can be first generated during design and evolved into real-time predictive approaches that provide operations with data that cannot be gained from sensors; when and where it is needed. Digital twins typically use physical data, limiting operators of in-field equipment to make operational decisions based on information from sensor locations and historical data alone. This can limit assessment of operational performance and integrity of complex production and process systems. In this paper the authors aim to show how, by combining predictive approaches, at differing levels of fidelity and based on fundamental scientific principles, it is possible to generate the missing data required, in both space and time. This can inform and guide operations; filling the gaps where and when physical data is not available. © 2022, Offshore Technology Conference. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Ocean-going vessels frequently experience severe weather conditions. Occasionally, the actual environmental loads are much larger than design values, resulting in deviations from design conditions that may cause serious structural damage. A structural digital twin can enhance predictability and reliability of marine structures, and thus provide vessel operators, owners, and stakeholders with a more accurate overview of a vessel's condition. It can also help reduce lifecycle costs through proposing rational and optimal inspection, maintenance, repair programs, and assist on maximizing service life and mission availability. This paper uses a benchmark vessel to investigate structural behaviors of the vessel through dynamic loading approach. The correlation between structure members and critical responses are established, and high stress concentration areas have been identified. Subsequently, this paper develops a conceptual digital twin architecture. The proposed digital twin predicts responses of the entire structure to measured or predicted environmental conditions with a hybrid model combining numerical simulations with measurements. While the traditional structural monitoring system focuses on the health condition of typical hot spots, the proposed digital twin may improve structural health awareness of the entire hull structure based on a limited number of sensors.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {ROV operations are mainly performed via a traditional control kiosk and limited data feedback methods, such as the use of joysticks and camera view displays equipped on a surface vessel. This traditional setup requires significant personnel on board (POB) time and imposes high requirements for personnel training. This paper proposes a virtual reality (VR) based haptic-visual ROV teleoperation system that can substantially simplify ROV teleoperation and enhance the remote operator's situational awareness. This study leverages the recent development in Mixed Reality (MR) technologies, sensory augmentation, sensing technologies, and closed-loop control, to visualize and render complex underwater environmental data in an intuitive and immersive way. The raw sensor data will be processed with physics engine systems and rendered as a high-fidelity digital twin model in game engines. Certain features will be visualized and displayed via the VR headset, whereas others will be manifested as haptic and tactile cues via our haptic feedback systems. We applied a simulation approach to test the developed system. With our developed system, a high-fidelity subsea environment is reconstructed based on the sensor data collected from an ROV including the bathymetric, hydrodynamic, visual, and vehicle navigational measurements. Specifically, the vehicle is equipped with a navigation sensor system for real-time state estimation, an acoustic Doppler current profiler for far-field flow measurement, and a bio-inspired artificial literal-line hydrodynamic sensor system for near-field small-scale hydrodynamics. Optimized game engine rendering algorithms then visualize key environmental features as augmented user interface elements in a VR headset, such as color-coded vectors, to indicate the environmental impact on the performance and function of the ROV. In addition, augmenting environmental feedback such as hydrodynamic forces are translated into patterned haptic stimuli via a haptic suit for indicating drift-inducing flows in the near field. A pilot case study was performed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the system design in a series of simulated ROV operation tasks. ROVs are widely used in subsea exploration and intervention tasks, playing a critical role in offshore inspection, installation, and maintenance activities. The innovative ROV teleoperation feedback and control system will lower the barrier for ROV pilot jobs. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {A development of physics-based digital twinning of a generic jack-up platform is presented in this paper. Due to lack of field measurement data, a generic large-scale jack-up model was designed, fabricated and tested in TCOMS ocean basin at 1:30 scale under different configurations, with the objective to provide highquality datasets to validate the proposed digital twin methodologies. The framework and the performance of the digital twin are demonstrated using a realistic and representative basin-scale model as a proof-ofconcept. Fundamental to any physics-based digital twins is the establishment of numerical models capable of reproducing consistent behaviors and responses of the physical assets. For this digital twin development, a full order model (FOM) and a reduced order model (ROM) are established. In view of uncertainties associated with the physical asset and numerical modelling, e.g., foundation fixities, leg stiffness, leg-hull connection stiffness and hydrodynamic coefficients, model updating or system identification is performed using the ROM to identify the parameters with relatively large uncertainties. A mapping between the parameters and the associated responses of the FOM and the ROM is subsequently established. After the model updating is completed with the identified parameters, good agreement in terms of the structural responses between the model test and numerical results can be achieved. Both the FOM and ROM are able to reproduce structural responses with good accuracy when compared to physical measurements. The ROM, being a linear structural model based on modal responses, is unable to account for larger nonlinear effects due to spudcan fixities, if any. Nevertheless, the ROM is suitable for fatigue evaluation considering fast computational speed and validity of the piecewise linear constraints as assumed for the foundation. The FOM, being less computationally efficient, is suitable for strength evaluation and able to account for any non-linear structural behaviors. The results of boundary displacements from the global dynamic response analysis can be mapped to a detailed local joint model to derive the hotspots stress for a more accurate fatigue evaluation. The digital twin framework for fatigue and strength evaluations based on measured wave loading is demonstrated for a better structural integrity management. As an emerging technology, digital twin will provide visibility of structural health condition to facilitate the transition from preventive to predictive and reliability-centered maintenance strategies. Although the digital twin framework presented in the paper makes use of a representative jack-up at model-scale, the proposed methodology can be potentially applied to full-scale operating jack-ups. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {Management of hydrate risk is a challenging problem in gas-condensate production systems. A "no inhibitor, no production" operational strategy is the norm due to the insufficiency of real-time knowledge of process conditions and hydrate kinetics in the field. This implies both lost-production costs and inadequate risk awareness. Recent advances in hydrate kinetics modeling in gas-dominated systems, based on fundamental research at the University of Western Australia (UWA), however, provide an opportunity for increased operational efficiencies and safety. This paper presents progress made in a joint-industry project (JIP) towards an integrated, real-time flow assurance model incorporating hydrate kinetics. This JIP leveraged existing data from UWA--including flowloopmeasurements and the modelling of hydrate growth and transport mechanisms--to achieve the integration of a hydrate kinetics model with an existing, field-proven multiphase flow simulator. This paper discusses the modeling, validation against experimental data, and the testing against historical data from a field system underhydrate-free and hydrating conditions. The model showed good agreement for multiphase flow prediction of laboratory experiments. Trends of pressure drop dependence on various flow parameters agreed as well. For field data of a large gas-condensate pipeline, the model correctly predicted when hydrates form and when they are absent. These simulations, further, revealed the sensitivity of overall hydrate holdup and distribution to several parameters, including ambient temperature, holdup profiles, water droplet entrainment, and the strength of hydrate-wall adhesion. Since number of these parameters are subjected to underlying uncertainties in field conditions, a viable hydrate monitoring/prediction tool ought to be based on ensembles of simulations (an analogy might be drawn to hurricane track prediction). This is particularly true for predicting the location of the hydrate blockage and the time-to-remediation. Currently, there is little modeling support to help manage hydrate risk in gas-condensate production operations without recourse to overly conservative strategies, such as overdosing. This model represents the first steps towards an online tool that can be integrated into digital twins of such fields. Such a tool will help optimize inhibitor consumption, reduce lost production costs, and provide early warning of hydrate blockage hazard. Potential end-user savings, from inhibitor consumption alone, are estimated at USD 500M in capital expenditure and USD 50M per annum in operational expenditure, for a typical moderate to large development. © 2022, Offshore Technology Conference.

	abstract = {As a data-driven organization, PETRONAS increases the demand for remote or autonomous operations on assets management. Visual Asset Management System (VAMS) is based on digital twin technology which digitalize asset inventory records and integrates multiple data sources that integrate engineering drawings, geo-tagged videos and 360° photographs with high intensity of spatial information in a cloud-based database. Intuitive dashboard showing the asset inventories allow asset management team to trace each inventory efficiently in a virtual reality model. A Proof-of-Concept (POC) of the VAMS was carried out on two newly installed offshore platforms. The findings showed that the centralized digital platform is effective for not only asset management but also production and maintenance operations. The POC results also demonstrated that VAMS minimize possible Health, Safety, Security and Environmental (HSSE) risks and exposure whereby site visit to the facility, safety induction, and HSSE walkabouts can be performed effectively in a safe virtual reality environment. This paper describes the POC and the implementation of VAMS for the two newly commissioned offshore facilities. It also discussed the technical challenges during the implementation, the perceive value creation, and the potentials and opportunities of the technology that we can leverage on to other fields or applications.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {In the wind energy industry, a digital twin (DT) is very useful for managing the operation of a wind turbine and predicting structural health conditions in real-time as well as projections in the near future. A real-time surrogate model is a very crucial part in building a DT. Towards that end, we employ a Reduced-Order Modelling (ROM) approach to construct a surrogate model for the environment-structure system of a bottom-fixed offshore wind turbine (OWT). The entire environment-structure system is broken down into major sub-systems of wind, wave, and structure. Based on the high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data, the wind ROM model can quickly provide the loadings on the components above water level in the parameter space spanned by the incoming wind speed, the rotational speed of the rotor, the pitch and tilt angles of the turbine. The hydro loadings on the underwater components of the OWT are solved by the empirical Morison formula. The OWT structural ROM model is component-based consisting of blades, hub, nacelle, tower, and monopile. The structural ROM model takes the loading data feeds from the wind and wave models to predict the structure responses of the OWT system, including stress. Since the DT is constructed via the component-based, it can also be used to play out “what if” scenarios when there are component level changes. For instance, the model can predict the system response of OWT when certain parts undergo structure failures. Benefiting from the cost-efficient ROM models, the DT is over two orders of magnitude faster than high-fidelity simulations while maintaining good accuracy. Copyright © 2023 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) has been recognized as one of the decarbonization pathways to reduce greenhouse (GHG) emissions and to achieve net zero. CO2 transportation is the key element from carbon capture to utilization such as enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or storage in existing wells. Using new or repurposed natural gas pipelines either offshore or onshore with real-time monitoring can prevent risks during transportation caused by impurities of carbon dioxide (CO2). It is unrealistic to manufacture new CO2 pipelines due to increasing overall project cost and carbon footprint. Retrofitting existing onshore or offshore natural gas pipelines with multiple sensors for flow measurement, pressure and temperature measurement and fatigue stress measurement can not only costeffectively reduce carbon footprint but also minimize maintenance costs through real-time risk-based inspection. The proposed solution will conclude with a holistic assessment of structural integrity in transporting CO2 and the integration of a data-driven model of repurposed natural gas pipelines to improve pipelines integrity further. Different impurities in the CO2 can change the flow properties during CO2 transportation. Although CO2 transportation has been deployed for several decades, the impacts of impurities in CO2 has to be better understood. Building a model with different impurities of CO2 in a digital twin has a potential influence to tackle this issue. A computational model of pipeline fatigue damage, which is affected by temperature and pressure mainly, in the pipelines is developed to predict the fatigue damage under specific circumstances. Integration of multiple sensors in the pipeline can avoid early failure and maintain it proactively. CO2 could be in liquid and gas phases in the unsaturated zone during transportation. The proposed concept of digital twin will offer a prediction at the early stage to mitigate potential risks specific to existing natural gas pipelines for CO2 transportation from carbon capture to utilization or storage. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {Reducing uncertainty in 3D carbonate rock type distribution is a critical factor that profoundly impacts field development for hydrocarbon or carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. Miocene carbonate reservoirs in the Central Luconia offshore region are economically important global gas reservoirs. The nature of these carbonate rocks can be visually distinct in the core and the multiscale reservoir heterogeneity might vary in scale from the 100-m scale to the sub-millimeter scale. This work presents a series of steps workflow to obtain spatial information about the organization scheme of carbonate rock types, and capture the most important petrophysical and sedimentary controls on rock property distribution in the E11 field, a carbonate buildup, located in Central Luconia Province, offshore Malaysia. The spatial data were generated from a supervised neural Kohonen algorithm. The rock types predicted with this workflow were propagated using IPSOM probabilized self-organizing maps SOM. This tool is used for classifying multivariate data samples according to “patterns” or multivariate responses. The workflow includes several steps: A Step 1—Core data description, B Step 2—Thin section description, C Step 3—Well log interpretation, and D Step 4—IPSOM probabilized self-organizing maps for facies prediction SOM. The depth plots of the predicted rock type showed close correspondence to the core-based rock types in terms of the stratigraphic organization of tight and reservoir layers, proportions, and juxtaposition. This result is sufficient to merit the application of the rock type logs into a future porosity model of the E11 field, and to understand the lateral and vertical distribution of tight and reservoir rock types of distribution. The results can be used to build a future realistic digital twin of the subsurface, and in digital geological modeling. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Reduced-order stick models are frequently employed to obtain dynamic amplification factors of self-elevating units (SEU), while the full-order finite element (FE) models are used for quasi-static analyses. This paper develops an efficient framework to create structural digital twins for SEUs by combining both stick models and full-order FE models. A stick model and a detailed FE model of an in-house developed generic SEU are established, respectively, following the standard industry guideline. Dynamic analyses are performed for the stick model based on the modal superposition method. Assuming that the stick model contains the key dynamic characteristics of the full-order FE model, the modal participation factors are multiplied by the corresponding mode shapes of the full FE model to derive the global dynamic responses of the entire SEU. The derived nodal displacements are imposed on the full-order model to obtain the member stresses. The global responses and member stresses are benchmarked with the results from a direct full-order dynamic FE analysis for various environmental conditions. The presented framework is found to significantly increase the efficiency of the simulation while retaining a similar accuracy, and it forms a critical step for the ongoing development of digital twins of fixed offshore structures. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The control performance of the product control system directly affects the operation performance of the product. Therefore, the design of the product control system is very important. The digital twin can effectively assist the design and development of products or systems. This paper fully combines the five-dimension digital twin model, and proposes a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation-driven design method of production control system based on digital twin. The bidirectional real-time flow characteristics of the digital twin data stream are fully utilized. At the same time, the problem of unrealistic imitation of the control system due to inaccurate product kinematics or dynamics modeling in the past is avoided, which greatly shortens the design cycle. This method is used to design the lifting control system of the jack-up offshore platform prototype, and the cross-coupling synchronous control of dual motors based on fuzzy proportion integration differentiation (PID) is realized. A digital twin model for the optimization design of the lifting control system is built, and the dynamic simulation and debugging of the prototype control system are carried out based on the model. The practice has proved that the design method proposed in this paper is more efficient and accurate than pure simulation-driven control system design. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The accurate description of the complex genesis and evolution of ocean waves, as well as the associated kinematics and dynamics is indispensable for the design of offshore structures and the assessment of marine operations. In the majority of cases, the water-wave problem is reduced to potential flow theory on a somehow simplified level. However, the nonlinear terms in the surface boundary conditions and the fact that they must be fulfilled on the unknown water surface make the boundary value problem considerably complex. Hereby, the contrary objectives with respect to a very accurate representation of reality and numerical efficiency must be balanced wisely. This paper investigates the influence of characteristic sea state parameters on the accuracy of irregular wave field simulations of different complexity. For this purpose, the high-order spectral method was applied and the underlying Taylor series expansion was truncated at different orders so that numerical simulations of different complexity can be investigated. It is shown that, for specific characteristic sea state parameters, the boundary value problem can be significantly reduced while providing sufficient accuracy. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In recent years there has been a growing appreciation in the offshore sector of the importance of developing reliable and robust methods to continuously monitor the integrity of floating production system moorings. Development efforts have mainly focused on detecting mooring failures which result in changes in the behaviour of the floating structure within a short time scale. However, these monitoring system technologies can also be leveraged to detect degradation in mooring system performance over longer time scales. The stiffness of a mooring system can be influenced by several factors including creep of synthetic rope, damage to rope construction, interlink wear of mooring chain, seabed trenching of mooring lines, excessive marine growth and loss of clump weights on mooring lines. Such changes in stiffness can change the dynamic response of the floating structure, potentially increasing the offset in extreme sea states beyond the allowable design offset limits. Hardware that measures mooring line loads or departure angles as a direct means of monitoring for mooring line failures can also be used to detect changes in mooring line pre-tension and therefore monitor for long-term changes in mooring stiffness. However, such hardware (load cells, inclinometers, sonar systems, strain gauging, etc.) can be expensive to retrofit, costly to maintain and suffer from long-term reliability issues. This has led to the implementation of solutions using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) vessel position data as a more cost-effective and reliable alternative for real-time mooring integrity monitoring. There are multiple methods by which a GNSS-based integrity monitoring system can be programmed to detect mooring failures, most commonly by employing machine learning models. This paper presents a method to extend a machine learning model used for a GNSSbased integrity monitoring system to also monitor for changes in mooring system stiffness, by leveraging the use of a digital twin and assessing long-term changes in measured excursions. This method will be demonstrated via a case study for a spreadmoored floating facility.  Copyright © 2023 by ASME.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach for implementation of digital twin (DT) based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of an Palfinger offshore knuckle boom crane. Contrary to most harbor gantry cranes, knuckle boom cranes are highly nonlinear mechanisms that cannot be represented by static reduced order twin models. Such cranes need to be solved by non-linear finite element solvers. The digital twin representation of the Palfinger crane is modelled and simulated real-time in a nonlinear finite element (FE) program, driven by inputs from physical sensors. Model reduction techniques are applied to enable DT co-simulation running two times faster than the physical crane. The inputs from the standard crane instrumentation are processed for noise reduction and singularity removal and converted to hydraulic actuator inputs. A simple inverse method for estimation of the crane payload is implemented based on hydraulic pressures. Structural loads due to wave induced ship motions are predicted based on sensor signals from the ship IMU. Based on the standard ship and crane instrumentation, the digital twin allows for real-time determination of stresses, strains and loads at an unlimited number of hot spots. Hence, a digital twin can be an effective tool for predictive maintenance of real offshore knuckle boom cranes with minor additional costs. The presented approach is described in a general manner and is applicable for offshore cranes used in the industry. © 2022 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Real-time monitoring of the existing natural gas infrastructure using multiple sensors is crucial to achieving higher confidence and lower risk during hydrogen transportation. One of the main challenges during hydrogen transportation is that hydrogen can accelerate the pipe material's fatigue crack growth rate, which can be affected by operational variables like hydrogen gas pressure, load ratio, and load cycle frequency. The proposed solution will involve the development of a digital twin framework incorporating a datadriven fatigue crack model of existing natural gas pipelines. The digital twin system comprises three main components. A computational finite element-based model of the crack defect in the pipe is developed to calculate the stress intensity factor (SIF) for different crack lengths and depths. The computation model is used to estimate the fatigue damage. The input and output data from the computational model are used to develop a metamodel or surrogate model. The metamodel is a data-driven model typically used to replace the computational FE model in real-time fatigue damage monitoring or to estimate the remaining fatigue life. The data-driven and computational model outputs the fatigue damage or remaining fatigue life, which is an essential part of the decision-making process in the digital twin framework. Machine learning-based algorithms: Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is used to estimate the SIF through a surrogate model. The result from surrogate model is compared with the Physics-based/ simulation model. This work uses Paris's law in the crack propagation model to calculate the fatigue crack's growth rate. Conventional S-N curve methods can only provide information about fatigue life, which typically corresponds to the point of fatigue damage initiation. In a digital twin system, the crack model predicts the crack growth or damage propagation which is a substantial advantage for real-time pipeline integrity management during hydrogen transportation. The proposed concept will provide a predictive early identification methodology for possible hazardous conditions specific to natural gas pipelines for hydrogen transportation. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen lifting through coil tubing is widely accepted as an efficient and reliable method for reviving a dead well. In offshore fields, it becomes more challenging to conduct a nitrogen lifting by coil tubing operation given the additional cost of securing a barge, cost of rigless well interventions, logistics and continuously changing weather conditions—all of which create a very limited window of opportunity to conduct a successful nitrogen lifting operation. This paper proposes an advanced method of conducting nitrogen lifting using coil tubing, optimizing for injection rate and depth of injection. The objective of this optimization is to reduce both operation time and consumed volume of nitrogen. By leveraging emerging technologies, an advanced production modeling algorithm using well digital twins was created to maximize lifting of liquid for each unit of gas injected. The method identified several parameters which can be used for nitrogen lifting by coil tubing—such as injection rate, depth of injection, and injection methodology. Ultimately, given the high levels of computing power needed to conduct this analysis, this method is optimal in offshore rigless activities where there is a limited window of opportunity to conduct rigless operations including nitrogen lifting by using coil tubing. Well digital twin was used to model well and fluid behavior under coil tubing conditions—ultimately calculating Gaslift Utilization Factor (GUF), which is a measure of how much liquid can be lifted for each unit of gas injected. Then, in an iterative process, all the possible parameters that can be changed would be altered to reach the highest GUF factor. As a pilot to see the outcomes of the advanced modeling algorithm, this method was deployed at an offshore well to revive a well back into normal production. The results were remarkable. There was a 40% reduction in the consumed nitrogen relative to traditional methods, and the job was completed 12 hours ahead of schedule. The tool provides two scenarios, one for most optimal scenario and another option in case the first scenario does not lift the expected volumes of fluid as anticipated. In the trial test, there was no need to resort to the second scenario. There are plenty of publications related to offshore rigless activities or the use of advanced modeling techniques. None, however, bridge the gap between the two areas combining advanced modeling with rigless operations to increase the efficiency and optimize to reduce cost and time. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

They are being heavily used in modern industrial applications, such as onshore and offshore wind farms, and for interconnection between asynchronous networks. However, the traditional proportional-integral (PI) control method is not robust enough to track the reference signal quickly and accurately during significant system disturbances. This paper proposes a robust adaptive back-stepping control (BSC) method that secures vulnerable power-electronic equipment. The adaptive BSC controller regulates the sum of capacitor energy, and the AC grid current through decoupled and closed control-loop design. The major advantage of the proposed control approach is the smooth transient response and accurate tracking ability, which is superior to classical control methods. In addition, the proposed methods have the merits of systematic and recursive design methodology and demand a low processing burden for Lyapunov functions and control laws. Moreover, the implementation particularities of the proposed approach are illustrated and verified for a power system digital twin using real-time digital simulator (RTDS). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Dealing with two combinations of high potential risks, HPHT wells and H2S hazards, is major challenge in project development. Reduction of offshore personnel and risk exposure hour becomes key aim of the project. Enable digitalization technologies becomes mainstream to promote project purpose. This paper demonstrates how digitalization is planned to implement and how it supports the HPHT and sour gas field development project. In addition to high risks, the overall cost of investment and the availability of modern technologies were evaluated, the plant design and operational concept focuses on remote control and operation with Not Normally Manned design concept. Digitalization will make production-effective development with the same functionality and robustness as human operations and maintenance of the facility's performance and safety. Main infrastructure including high bandwidth low latency wired/wireless network across facilities, and real-time onboard data and intelligent platform are prepared to support digitalization readiness. Personnel risk offshore is minimized through the remote-control concept which the facility is monitored from onshore with capability to remote reset/restart, health and performance monitoring, remote decision-making and execution, and crew assistance. Robotic technology will also be considered as additional means for remote monitoring. Secondary control room located offshore linked through fiber optic cable with the same degree of control as onshore will be included to allow local operations during commissioning, start-up, early operation, troubleshooting and maintenance campaigns. The project targets to deploy real-time digital data platform for monitoring and inspection producing large amounts of data for analysis to increase efficient operations. Digital twin application, where the real-time data, and repository of information on the equipment can be used for operations and maintenance purposes, can be further implemented, i.e., design phase for process control design and simulation, training simulator during plant start-up, and plant optimization during operational phase. The personnel and equipment tracking on real-time basis will also be considered to encourage fast and efficient evacuation in an emergency. All systems are designed based on best practices design in Cybersecurity concepts to enable protected related networks, equipment, location and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. Introducing nowadays digitalization technologies in the project, could reduce hazardous risks and number of personnel activities on the facilities as well as optimizing production operations performance. It should be started at the early stage of the project. Main challenge is lacking successfully reference and benchmarking projects. All digitalization applications and technologies should be carefully assessed and validated to ensure that they are suitable and valuable for the project requirements.

	abstract = {Unlocking future development opportunities for brown fields are deemed to be a challenge from Urban Plan (UP) prospective. A field "A" of this paper subject is located south of Oman and was discovered in 1956. The reservoir in this field is a clastic formation divided into two main units; A and B, separated by a 10-15m thick lacustrine shale. The field is an onshore and is under waterflood since 1990s. The development of this paper subject was initially coupled with a nearby Field in the same cluster "Field B" for infill waterflood followed by polymerflood concept. The field development plan (FDP) calls for infill drilling in Inverted "9-spot" patterns with tighter well spacing in the Unit-A, convert corner Oil Producer (OP) to Water Injector (WI) and this development is to be associated with a totally new Urban Plan "revamp" that requires a demolition of the existing facilities. It also called for developing Unit-B through dedicated (twin) wells instead of comingling with Unit-A (to be supported by field trials). Moreover, selectively abandon horizontal producers in mitigating collision or interference risk with infill wells and to De-risk the full field polymer development through a new dedicated polymer pilot using new polymer molecular weight based on core flooding experiments data. The project was parked in 2014 at Decision Gate 3b (DG3b) because it was not economic with a very high Unit Technical Cost (UTC). Since then, great efforts were made by the Asset team to drive project competitiveness and be able to mature the project. Main steps achieved were; 1) de-risking/validating infill development concept by accelerating part of the FDP drilling scope utilizing the existed facility with very attractive economics; which unlocked an alternative full field urban plan concept of retrofitting instead of revamp resulted in drastic drop of project UTC, 2) Completing FDP proposed field extension appraisal scope (added additional 63 infill well locations), 3) Optimizing Water Treatment Plant (WTP) scope utilizing available field historical injection data, 4) Proposing Integrated Project Contracting Strategy (IPM) for drilling project wells to reduce drilling cost, 5) Proven comingling concept of Unit-A and B instead of twining through a dedicated pilot and 6) Successfully de-risked full field polymerflood development through a two years dedicated pilot. All these steps have led to successfully mature the project to Final Investment Decision (FID) in Q3 2020. This paper will demonstrate the key development challenges and risks, key steps made to validate/de-risk the proposed concepts before the full field implementation and the capital efficiency Journey to improve project competitiveness through an integrated subsurface and surface efforts.

	abstract = {In mature offshore hydrocarbon fields, an increasing number of aging assets have reached or exceeded design life, meaning fatigue is of growing concern. Digital twins incorporating a fatigue model are typically used to assess structural integrity and inform decisions on life of field extension. However, they rely on idealized wave models which cannot truly reflect the hydrodynamic loading, which leads to uncertainty and conservatism. The operator of the Ninian Southern Platform in the UK North Sea concluded that if strain could be monitored in situ at key subsea locations, they could develop a more accurate relationship between sea conditions and structural loading, which could be used to calibrate the asset fatigue model, providing enhanced understanding of the jacket integrity. We describe the development, validation, installation, and first field results from an instrument designed to meet that challenge. Retrofitting strain sensors to subsea structural members presents many technical challenges, as neither conventional strain gauges nor cabled connections are feasible in the harsh subsea environment. For the first deployment, the instrumentation required robust attachment to a 1.2 m diameter tubular member situated at 43 m depth, which would withstand 100-year metocean maxima. It needed a strain transfer mechanism for autonomous measurement of the smallest fatigue-inducing strain reversals on three quadrants of the tubular over a two-year period. Strains were to be continuously sampled and recorded at a sufficient rate to accurately capture the peak values. Additionally, accelerations in three axes and wave height derived from hydrostatic pressure were to be monitored. The whole package had to be installed by ROV, and needed to deliver periodic data downloads throughout the life of the instrument. At the heart of the instrument is a set of environmentally packaged strain transfer mechanisms. These engage with the surface of the structure through spring-loaded actuators that are deployed by the ROV during installation. They allow strains to be measured directly by the instrument’s data acquisition system. These mechanisms were validated and calibrated using specially designed test equipment. Prior to deployment, the complete instrument, including its magnetic attachment system, was tested on a sample pipe section. All instrument subsystems were proven, including a high-speed optical data link for through-water transfer of recorded data, and an acoustic communication system for status updates. The instrument was successfully deployed subsea in April 2021, and one complete and continuous data set has already been retrieved. The data shows that the instrumentation is able to accurately capture a range © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {Autonomous Operations is about utilising the latest available fit-for-purpose technology in operations, maintenance, inspection, and asset optimisation. It involves collecting operating data such as visual, thermal, low-and high-frequency acoustic, FLIR (Forward Looking InfraRed), and gas-sensing through devices mounted on autonomous robots or drones, possibly mixed with stand-alone fixed devices. This "mobile sensor" approach is ideal for existing infrastructure where adding enhanced sensing capabilities with an IoT solution is cost prohibitive. It is flexible: if a site is modified, the robots can be given a new route to monitor. It is also future proof as sensors can be easily upgraded as technology advances. Autonomous robot inspection is enabled by a software platform designed for full processing "at Edge" as a typical robotics inspection generates tens of gigabytes of data per hour. Data pre-processing, construction of detailed 3D temperature, vibration amplitude and gas concentration maps, identification of anomalies, their classification by criticality and communication to operators is done by computers at the facility. Time lapse analysis is used to process the data either in-situ, or remotely, depending on site connectivity. Reports are automatically generated indicating whether the site is functioning within normal working conditions, or an anomaly has been detected. The electronic reports contain the 3D model and are viewable on mobile devices providing the field engineer with detailed diagnostic data literally at their fingertips. The process builds and maintains the living digital twin without having to expend engineering hours to update 3D models. This process not only removes the need for people, which reduces cost and safety risk, but also improves reliability by increasing the available data set and reducing inspection intervals. By utilising data analytics and artificial intelligence, the anomalies detected can be risk ranked, prioritised and scheduled based on a latest acceptable completion date. This technology has been tested through a pilot program at an activated carbon plant in Wyoming during the summer of 2021. In this paper, we will present a case study of this pilot, covering installation, data acquisition and processing, as well as the key challenges and results. © 2022, Offshore Technology Conference.

	abstract = {A digital twin representing the drilling system of a dynamically positioned (DP) mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) has been developed and deployed in offshore Brazil. The primary output of the digital twin is a set of dynamic watch circles which are generated based off the predicted drift-off behavior of the MODU under real-time environmental conditions. The watch circles, together with vessel and weather status information, are displayed to the crew on board and updated on an hourly basis. This paper describes the development of the software platform on which the digital twin is built, together with the underlying drilling system model and solution parameters, which uniquely include the effect of the marine riser restoring force. Integration with external data streams is presented, including vessel position and heading, riser tension, and environmental data (wind, wave, and current). The system outputs, including the local user interface on the vessel and the output data stream to the operator’s real-time data center via the WITSML protocol, are also described. The digital twin with dynamic watch circle output has been successfully utilized on a campaign of shallow-water wells for plug-and-abandonment (P&A) operations in concert with BOP tethering and subsea realtime monitoring systems. Together, these systems ensured safe operations and wellhead protection in a challenging environment for dynamically positioned MODUs. Additionally, the operator was able to gather correlated data streams monitoring the weather conditions, vessel status, dynamic watch circle estimation, subsea drilling system status, and tether loads. The digital twin and dynamic watch circle system enables drilling and completion operations to be performed under conditions judged to be untenable when evaluated via traditional operability analysis methods involving statistically predicted environmental conditions. © 2022, Offshore Technology Conference.

	abstract = {Wave energy is a renewable energy source with the potential to contribute to the global electricity demand, but a remaining challenge is the survivability of the wave energy converters in harsh offshore conditions. To understand the system dynamics and improve the reliability, experimental and numerical studies are usually conducted. However, these processes are costly and time-consuming. A statistical model able to provide equivalent results is a promising approach. In this study, the digital twin of the CFD solution is developed and implemented for the prediction of the force in the mooring system of a point-absorber wave energy converter during extreme wave conditions. The results show that the digital twin can predict the mooring force with 90.36% average accuracy. Moreover, the digital twin needs only a few seconds to provide the solution, while the CFD code requires up to several days. By creating a digital analog of a wave energy converter and showing that it is able to predict the load in critical components during extreme wave conditions, this work constitutes an innovative approach in the wave energy field. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In order to realize the benefits of the digitalization and automation of production and processing systems, users first need to increase the level of integration, controllability and monitoring capabilities of each component applied. Therefore, digital twins turn out to be a highly important asset not only for designing greenfield applications, but also for improving brownfield machines. Up to now, digital twins were barely implemented to their full potential throughout the design, integration, and operation phases of production and processing equipment. Based on the experiences gained during the development of a subsea valve actuator, this paper highlights the importance of the digital twin to speed up the engineering and qualification of an innovative mechatronic system, reducing not only the time to market, but also increasing quality and allowing a fast reaction to the experience of the users. As a perspective, the paper shows how an accurate digital twin is a key to successful integration of a new component into complex machines. This includes the entire product lifecycle, from the conceptual work of a system and its virtual commissioning up to remote cloud-based monitoring systems. This paper finishes with an overview of some of the challenges which need to be resolved by the cooperation among different players in order to allow a wide and deep application of Digital Twin in the energy sector industry. © 2022, Offshore Technology Conference.

	abstract = {A digital twin is proposed to quantify the loads and mitigate the risk of rupture during the recovery operation of a flexible riser with severe structural weakness (30% of broken wires in the outer tensile armor layer). The allowable axial tension is compared with the loads expected during operation to establish safe operating limits. The digital twin is divided into a local model and a global model. The local analysis uses a finite element model to investigate how stresses on tensile armor wires change when the number of broken wires increases. It considers all pipe layers and two configurations, 1) straight and 2) with a curvature expected during the recovery operation. The FPSO motion performance is calibrated by offshore field measurements and improved RAOs for the global analysis are provided based on the measured motions. Finally, the allowable axial load from the local analysis is compared with the expected loads from the global analysis. The local model is simulated stepwise with 0-28 broken wires and indicated a reduction of 83% in allowable axial load with 25 broken wires. The results were combined with global simulations considering different sea states to provide insights about how close the loads might be to the allowable limit during operation and what loads the riser was subjected to since the last broken wires were detected. This analysis allowed the identification of the most critical steps in operation and helped to design the procedure to achieve ALARP risks. Finally, operating limits were discussed to keep the estimated load inside the established limits. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {Cenovus Energy has deployed a rigorous multiphase flow assurance online solution to detect leaks and monitor hydrate formation conditions at the White Rose Field and satellite extensions 350 km east of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Twenty-five production wells are connected via subsea manifolds to the SeaRose floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) system, through four flexible flowlines and risers. An online subsea advisor has been developed to provide control-room operators with enhanced monitoring/visibility in detecting potential leaks and hydrate formation within the subsea system, including the mechanical flowline connectors. The online solution makes use of a commercial multiphase flow simulator. An online real-time mode (RTM) was developed to simulate the production loops connecting the manifolds to the SeaRose FPSO. The wells are equipped with multiphase flowmeters, which are calibrated at regular intervals during well test campaigns. Reconciled flow rates from the meters are used as inlet boundary conditions to the real-time multiphase model. This RTM acts as a digital twin of the production network. As part of the online subsea advisor leak detection system (LDS), Schlumberger has delivered improved algorithms for leak detection in multiphase production networks. The solution makes use of 14 signatures indicating leaks, which form the basis for a generalized multivariable LDS. Artificial intelligence and data clustering are used to determine whether the signature vector indicates a leak. By making use of multiple leak signatures, the system becomes more robust with respect to sensor faults and drift. Multiple signatures also reduce the number of false alarms and make the LDS less dependent on model calibration. The use of signatures, artificial intelligence and data clustering is new compared to traditional mass balance model-based LDS. The theory is described with results from four of these 14 signatures in the paper. The advisor system monitors the potential for hydrate formation conditions and calculates the hydrate margin at the flowline connectors, which have been identified as potential "cold spots." A rigorous flowline connector model has been implemented at positions along the flow path where they exist in the field. This model is fine-tuned to estimate mechanical flowline connector wall temperatures. This gives the control-room operators a realistic estimate of reaction time to manage an emergency shutdown and initiates an alarm when hydrate conditions will be reached, prompting immediate action of predefined safeguard measures. © 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers},

	abstract = {Offshore wind turbines founded on monopiles are highly dynamic structures in which the stiffness of the soil adjacent to the monopile controls the natural frequency of the structure. As the loading regime and ground conditions surrounding the foundation are subject to considerable uncertainty, adaptable digital twins of the offshore structures are valuable as they allow the use of in-field monitoring data for model updating. As soil conditions and water depths are rarely uniform across a wind farm site, each structure is expected to behave differently. To back-analyse structural performance, geotechnical and structural data needs to be retrieved at every foundation location. A serverless cloud-based application was developed to allow quick and reliable storage and retrieval of geotechnical and structural data. The database was combined with an API layer to allow parametric data retrieval for back-analyses and digital twin updating across an entire wind farm. As the web application is hosted in the cloud, the data can be accessed through simple HTTP requests by authenticated users working offshore, in the office or remote. The performance of this solution is illustrated with a case study in which foundation stiffness across an entire wind farm site is parametrically calculated and updated. © 2022, The Author(s).},

The Digital Twin is a live diagnosis tool that provides critical information about the actual cool down time of critical locations in the Subsea Production System (SPS), in the event of an unplanned shut down. Based on verified Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools, Thermal Insight adopts a holistic full field view and feeds back the actual cool down time in predetermined stringent locations to the operator. This facilitates well informed decision making, opposed to immediate shut down and cold restart following conservative cool down requirements and philosophies. The inner workings of the Digital Twin are a Reduced Order Model (ROM) set of differential equations based on a-priori CFD simulations which reveals the cool down time in critical locations, and not only in the location of installed hardware (PTT sensors). The CFD results are used to correlate the real time temperature readings from the Pressure/Temperature Transducer (PTT) to cool down times in the most stringent parts of the SPS, limiting the number of cold restarts to when it is really needed. This paper will outline the CFD model verification work along with the Digital Twin deployed onto an example scenario based on actual field data from an operator. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

The implementation of state-of-the-art tools and the development of new solutions via R,D&I projects are important steps on the path to increase the integrity management evolution. Several programs and activities are in course on the three major related areas for the operational assurance of the asset: subsea, topsides and marine (including vessel structure). The inspection and maintenance markets were forced to accelerate the tools and systems development during the last years of Pandemic due to social distancing rules, so the need to remotely control activities and equipment became more important and valuable. The necessity to keep people away of the site has pushed the implementation of wearables, permanent monitoring systems usage, drones, robots and ROVs (Remoted Operated Vehicles), mini-ROVs and AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle). The operation team is currently investigating new ways to reduce human effort in tasks such as thickness measurement and visual inspection by using recent technologies to improve the inspection quality. This paper aims to outline the integrity management evolution roadmap, which is based on integrated programs on subsea, topsides, and marine inspection and maintenance that, working aligned, will end in a centrally stored collected data from several sources that will be available and displayed in each asset's Digital Twin model. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {The Digital Twin concept has been used for many years in the oil and gas industry, typically supporting the simulation of data for training and planning. A more expansive advanced Digital Twin concept is now becoming the norm, providing owner-operators with a seamless integrated end-user experience. This advanced Digital Twin combines spatial information with schematics and static data, integrated with dynamic data from multiple systems of records. The advanced Digital Twin concept is particularly appealing for offshore owner-operators who are looking to reduce costs and improve safety. Reducing costs associated with the number of people offshore can only be done safely if there is better quality information available onshore. As well as conveying and visualizing information in a location- and context-aware manner, the advanced Digital Twin also supports the introduction of new technology such as virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and machine learning. These new technologies help provide better insights for owner-operators across the entire lifecycle of an offshore asset, from cost avoidance during construction, operational improvements during training, and support for integrity management and fabric maintenance during operation. There are different maturity levels for Digital Twins in offshore oil and gas. As technology continues to advance and owner-operators increase adoption there is the prospect of more mature Digital Twins that specify actions without human intervention. There is an opportunity to greatly streamline offshore operations, reducing costs, improving safety, and enabling rapid reaction to external conditions. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

One of the main objectives of the digital twin is to provide continuous real-time virtual instrumentation, as well as aggregated information related to flow assurance and integrity management with a novel multidimensional model-based leak detection workflow. The digital twin workflows enable operators to better prepare and respond to planned and unplanned events in the field and to analyze and optimize performance of the field, in combination with a data analytics tool. Subsea wet gas flow meters (WGFM) in the field initially provided flow rate information to deep water operations in line with the operational strategy. After one year in production, a reduction in WGFM performance was observed. A mitigation strategy was developed to use the digital twin flow rate calculations combined with the remaining WGFMs for improved operational decision making. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {This paper highlights technical and practical challenges that the authors have faced to create a digital twin (DT) of a piece of manufacturing system, that is production process (i.e., assembly process) to serve system responsiveness (i.e., agility) in an offshore wind turbine manufacturing. It discusses the elements and architectural parameters in development of an agile manufacturing system, where DT of shopfloor and its practical setup is seen as a design element enabling agility in an industrial system. Currently, there is no detailed framework to describe how industries can practically benefit a DT of their production process in a way that their manufacturing systems becomes responsive to perturbations, and ultimately agile. More importantly, there is no detailed study to show potential challenges and their implications during deployment of such a DT. In absence of such a study, this paper proposes a configuration and practical architecture, customized for Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy’s (SGRE’s) offshore wind turbine (OWT) manufacturing system, that denotes the logic behind such framework for reuse of DT in any typical manufacturing system along with its practical implications, helping other industries to predict potential challenges and estimate realistically the required budget for such implementation. The proposed model-based structure is built up based on the benchmark commonalities and differences of the known developed DT models in manufacturing and production context, incorporating the existing physical and virtual spaces in SGRE’s OWT manufacturing system, complemented by supplementary systems and software applications from existing technologies in market. The paper concludes with thoughts on a pilot project in production line of an OWT’s generator unit that is under development to verify such a design. © ECMS Enrico Vicario, Romeo Bandinelli, Virginia Fani, Michele Mastroianni (Editors) 2023.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an algorithm to design ship power systems in the preliminary design phase. As a case study, an embedded control is integrated into the preliminary design of the ship power system, at the level of Energy Management System (EMS). The embedded control developed for the algorithm aims for cost, availability, safety and emissions optimization from the top layer. At the power system level, a few alternatives are considered such as full electric propulsion and fuel-based energy producers. Different Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), Key Exception Indicators (KEIs) and Key Improvement Indicators (KIIs) for design are evaluated for cost optimization purposes. Power plant sizing results of an Offshore Supply Vessel based on batteries or Generating Sets (GENSETs) power contribution are extracted with the proposed pro-clean power plant design algorithm structure. The result of this first simplified simulation not just include a comparative evaluation between 7 different types of batteries for an all electric ship sizing but also a maximum and instantaneous Depth of Discharge (DoD) of the batteries among the OSV load profile register which could be used as a control bandwidth to consider at the EMS level. The presented algorithm structure is a preface for later hybrid systems power plant sizing generalization.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {PTTEP's natural gas fields in Gulf of Thailand, has encountered losses in Condensate yield due to suboptimal operating conditions as variation in feed compositions occurs when production line up changes. As a result of this suboptimal operation, some light Condensate is lost into gas phase resulting in lower overall profitability. As part of company's Digital Transformation initiatives, a Condensate Stabilizer Optimization (CSO) solution has been implemented to minimize or eliminate these losses. The objective of CSO is to provide real-time recommended operating conditions to maximize condensate production while maintaining sale condensate specification using optimization technology that considers all relevant condensate stabilization process parameters. The CSO solution leverages Multivariable Predictive Control or Model Predictive Control (MPC) technology and communicates the obtained results to offshore teams via an online web user interface. Besides the dynamic models and MPC technology, the solution also includes an important component of the CSO solution which is the web based online dashboards as they are the key to communicate between the solution and the users. The dashboards include the following key features: - Key operating parameters of Condensate Stabilizer Units including Controlled, Manipulated, and Disturbance Variables - Recommended optimal values of Manipulated Variables to achieve maximum condensate production - Difference between actual vs predicted RVP. This is to visualize current model accuracy - Captured Benefit As of December 2021, the CSO solution has been fully utilized for 5 months, i.e. Go-Live since August 2021. During this period, it has successfully delivered not only safe operating window but also benefits which adds up to 1.49 MUSD/year. As the benefits of the solution have been proven, a plan to proceed with Phase 2 of this project, in which the CSO solution will be integrated with the Distributed Control System (DCS) allowing MPC Controller to automatically adjust process parameters to achieve the most optimal conditions, has been set. Apart from process optimization, the CSO solution can be used to evaluate operating scenarios based on given simulated process parameters, thus becoming a true "Digital Twin" of the Condensate Stabilizer that can replicate its operation at different operating conditions.

	abstract = {The electrical energy system is transforming itself into a sustainable energy supply in response to the decline in fossil fuels. This conversion is driving the expansion of renewable energy facilities such as photovoltaic plants and wind power plants. Except for large hydropower plants and offshore wind farms, the integration of renewable energies takes place predominantly in the medium- and low-voltage distribution networks. This leads to a lack of observability and increasing grid complexity. Consequently, distribution network operators are constantly faced with a challenge in terms of observability. A comprehensive installation of measuring instruments in the medium- and low-voltage networks has proved economically unviable. An alternative approach to network state monitoring within the framework of power grid digital twin (DT) is therefore developed in this paper. The patterns of the electrical energy system are detected and modeled employing an artificial neural network (ANN) in connection with the associated harmonic spectra. Based on this DT model, the active powers of renewable energy facilities are estimated through the measured voltage data. In this regard, this work is first devoted to the modeling of an ANN-based DT estimator. The proposed power state estimation is then validated with the measured data from a field test. The accuracy of the estimation will be investigated according to the different influencing factors.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the next 5-10 years, it is to be expected that normally unmanned production platforms (and eventually autonomous platforms) with a single yearly maintenance intervention will become the norm. This paper describes the basis for achieving this objective by integrating digital twins for the Process and Asset Performance/Maintenance domains. The Process Twin described has been deployed in real-world field applications and provides the necessary level of reliability and accuracy to allow for closed-loop production optimization in real-time (i.e., optimized setpoints are pushed directly to the DCS or SCADA without manual verification or validation). The process model covers the entire production value chain, including reservoir, wells, risers, process facilities, sale of product, etc. Multiple constraints can be entered into the optimization engine, giving operators the ability to define a bespoke landscape for their optimization based on several key performance indicators (KPIs) related to production, process, economic, and environmental requirements. The Asset Performance Twin complements the Process Twin by continuously generating the remaining Useful Life (RUL) of equipment. In the event that RUL does not match the timing of the next planned maintenance campaign, an alternative operational scenario can be calculated to extend the RUL. The Process Twin then optimizes production around this new constraint, with the ultimate objective being to minimize unplanned downtime and associated manual interventions. © 2022, Offshore Technology Conference.

	abstract = {Vibration-based load reconstruction at support structures of offshore wind turbines. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of the tower and foundation structures of offshore wind turbines is an established and acknowledged technical rule in engineering practice. The acquisition, assessment and analysis of the acting fatigue loads is an essential aspect in this field of SHM, since it enables the optimization of turbine operation towards lower fatigue lifetime consumption and provides potential for the extension of service life. Fatigue loads can either be measured directly using strain gauges or indirectly reconstructed from the measurement of tower deformations in conjunction with a mechanical model, e. g., a finite element (FE) model. The indirect reconstruction can also be described by the notions of “virtual sensors” or “digital twin”. The current report presents how fatigue loads on relevant areas of offshore foundation structures, such as the tower-transition piece interface, can be reconstructed from acceleration and inclination measurements. The approach uses the structural responses recorded at the tower and an FE model to determine internal forces or moments in the structure. Using real examples from German offshore wind farms, the effect of the available measurement information and considered load assumptions on the estimation accuracy is shown. The effects of uncertainties from acquisition and model assumptions (e. g. calibration errors and soil stiffness) are also presented. © 2022, Ernst und Sohn. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Digital twin (DT) is recognized as a promising tool to perform reliability analysis for offshore platforms. An open issue in developing the DT reliability analysis tool is to establish a high-fidelity highly-precise virtual model for the offshore platform of interest, where the virtual model is able to update its model parameters using actual sensory measurements to eliminate/reduce the effect of parameters uncertainty. To address this challenging issue, this paper proposes a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based Bayesian updating method to build the requested virtual model for an offshore jacket platform. In this new method, the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the offshore jacket platform, extracted both from the structural dynamic responses of a finite element (FE) model and the sensory measurements in the physical system, are used to construct the likelihood function of the Bayesian inference. Then, the posterior probability distribution function (PDF) of the uncertain parameters is derived under the assumption of uniform prior distribution, which will be used to generate the Markov Chains by implementing the Metropolis-Hastings sampling. Hence, the most probable values of the uncertain parameters can be obtained from the Markov Chains for updating the FE model. A numerical study demonstrates high effectiveness of the proposed model updating method, even with high-level measurement noise and model uncertainty. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {From the viewpoint of safety and sustainability, the demand for autonomous vessels is increasing. Due to technical and administrative limitations, achieving a fully autonomous ship is through sequential development and application, and this can be confirmed through the 4 unmanned surface ship degrees [1] established by the IMO. As an intermediate step, the main concern is the operation of the ship with minimal onboard crews, and this is a similar situation for offshore structures. In a crew-minimized environment, one crew member should be able to perform multi-discipline techniques, but it is practically impossible to establish such an environment in a short period of time. For this reason, research and development are focused on systemic support to onboard crews that can operate and maintain in a minimal crew environment. And the activities define a vessel in this operating environment as a smart vessel and approach it as a pre-stage of fully autonomous vessels. In case of smart ships, studies like [2] are being conducted on monitoring and detecting abnormal situations in equipment that occur during operation on ships. In addition, studies [3] are being conducted to converge condition monitoring data and the cyber physical system and apply them to ships and offshore structures. These studies are related to systems supporting the maintenance in point of the Fail Safety, and the purpose of the Fail Safety is to support the sustainable operation of ships or offshore structures. The Fail Safety system consists of two main components, those are the diagnosis of the equipment status based on the monitoring information and supporting a proper maintenance plan based on the diagnosis result. In this study, the Fail Safety system related to providing maintenance plan is developing to consider the working environment to support effective maintenance work information for workers who need to perform unfamiliar work in non-specialized fields. In the above system, a maintenance support code related to an abnormal condition of equipment or system is generated through Condition Based Monitoring system and transmitted to a remote maintenance management system. Based on the maintenance support code, an appropriate Maintenance Work Package is generated which developed through this research. The selected Maintenance Work Package provides maintenance details by visualizing documents, drawings, or 3D model instructions with digital twin to workers. For maintenance situations that are not resolved through Maintenance Work Package, the system is designed to support maintenance through remote expert support or to share work status for requiring decision-making. In addition, to verify the system, the mock-up verification process of the test bed is introduced. © 2022, Avestia Publishing. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The wake management of offshore wind farms (OWFs) mainly considers the wake effect. Wake effects commonly occur in offshore wind farms, which cause a 5–10% reduction in power production. Although there have been many studies on wake management, many methods are not accurate enough; for instance, look-up table and static wake model control methods do not consider the time-varying wake state. Dynamic wake management is based on the real-time dynamic wake, so it can increase the energy of the OWFs effectively. For OWFs, dynamic wake control is the main method of dynamic wake management. In this paper, the existing wake model and control progress are discussed, mainly emphasizing the dynamic wake model and the dynamic wake control method, solving the gap of the review for dynamic wake management. This paper presents a digital twins (DT) framework for power and fatigue damage for the first time. The structure of this paper is as follows: (1) the mechanism of wind farm wake interference is described and then the dynamic wake model is reviewed and summarized; (2) different control methods are analyzed and the dynamic wake management strategies for different control methods are reviewed; (3) in order to solve the problems of dynamic wake detection and real-time effective control, the technology of DT is applied to the dynamic wake control of OWFs. This new DT frame has a promising application prospect in improving power and reducing fatigue damage. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In 2009, the Vito field was discovered in more than 4,000 ft of water approximately 150 miles offshore from New Orleans, Louisiana. The project produces from reservoirs nearly 30,000 feet below sea level. This paper outlines the approach taken to develop the Vito facilities operating model (Operating Model) and prepare for start-up and ramp-up. This paper is part of a Vito Project series at OTC 2023, and the other papers are listed in the references. In 2015 the project faced significant financial hurdles and went through a refresh of the concept design to reduce cost and simplify while maintaining safety as a top priority. This re-design resulted in reduced redundancy and operational flexibility including reducing host personnel on board (POB) capacity to 60 personnel. To prepare to start-up and operate the facility with this simplified design, a proactive approach was adopted across four key areas: Operating Model, maintenance strategy, digital building blocks, and start-up ramp-up (SURU) planning. An Operating Model was developed to enable efficient execution of maintenance and operations activities with the reduced POB. This model leverages multiskilling of onsite personnel and enabling digital technologies. The limited POB necessitated development of a maintenance strategy that is both lean and comprehensive with high utilization of the base crew. With local performance standards as the foundation of the strategy, a Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) study was performed to validate and further optimize the defined strategy, which relies heavily on asst specific maintenance tasks and onshore sparing due to minimal redundancy and space on host for spares. Digital Twin technology has been leveraged to create a virtual mirror image of the Vito facility that is a central repository of equipment data and documentation. This enables virtual planning of work which reduces POB needs by providing the ability to perform walkdowns, take measurements and identify access issues without being on site. Augmented reality technology supplements this by streaming the viewpoint of offshore staff directly to onshore teams to perform troubleshooting, diagnose issues, and inspect without requiring physical presence. To manage well start-up and to optimize long term recovery, a start-up ramp-up model was implemented with a focus on proactive actions to optimize start-up. This led to long term lease of onshore caverns to eliminate requirements for temporary unloading equipment during start-up. A phased commissioning and © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {Control valves are integral to the piping infrastructure in most process industries including nuclear, oil and gas, and chemical. They serve as pressure, temperature, and flow rate regulators. Hence detailed information about these parameters within the complex valve shape is particularly useful for design, optimisation, and efficient operation of control valves. For better reliability and operation under safety-critical installations, extensive research is being carried out to develop multi-layer and knowledge-intensive digital twins for such valves. This paper reports a computational investigation to determine the local valve flow coefficient (Cv) at various valve opening positions (VOP)/flow rate conditions and develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the local Cv distribution within the valve-pipe system. This is expected to provide sufficient information to embed extensive knowledge base in the valve's digital twin. Ten internal locations (at L/D=1 to 10) were chosen for data extraction to give a detailed Cv profile from the pipe inlet through the valve to the pipe outlet. Three VOPs (20, 60, and 100%) were considered and for each, three inlet velocities of 1, 2 and 3 m/s were simulated. This combination resulted in a database of 90 data-points which were used to train the ANN using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. MATLAB's Neural Network Toolbox was used with 70%, 15%, and 15% of the data used for training, validation, and testing, respectively. Model performance was measured using the mean-square-error and square-of-residuals (R2) metrics. Sensitivity analysis of hidden layer neuron number was conducted, and the results show that 10 neurons produced a robust prediction of the CV profile. An overall average R2 of 0.92 was obtained. Hence, it may be efficiently used for the valve's internal (rather than global) CV prediction for design and other purposes - including implementation within digital twin architectures for remote/condition monitoring in difficult to reach areas such as offshore and within complex industrial sites.  © 2022 IEEE.},

The literature is especially sparse for system tests where multiple failures occur and interact. In this work, a laboratory-level experiment is conducted to mimic many of the properties of larger and more complex marine structures with redundant load paths, failure interaction, and component-to-system level integration. In the experiment, such properties are reflected by a hexagon tension specimen with four propagating fatigue cracks tested under displacement-controlled loading. The applied loading cycles and corresponding crack lengths are recorded as the major time-varying data of degradation, with the resisting force at maximum extension used as the system capacity. A novel computer vision method is used to measure the crack length. Strain gauges are also used to monitor the structure's status. The experimental data is presented and analyzed in this paper. The resulting data sets can be used to evaluate the performance of different digital twin updating approaches. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Digital Twin (DT) provides a virtual and digital representation of existing assets, spanning everything from onshore facilities to offshore platforms, pipelines and subsurface data, all in one location. It has been used for the flagship Manatee project to develop 3 stacked reservoirs, which will be one of the largest projects in Shell Trinidad and Tobago (STT). Gas from these wells is expected to be processed via a new platform and transported via a long offshore pipeline pipeline to the Beachfield onshore facility. The DT was used to identify design modifications required at this onshore site and visualize the proposed offshore assets. It integrates existing facilities and new design data, including site survey, subsurface and wells data to optimize the well planning. With access to an integrated visualization platform for both surface and subsurface 3D and 4D data and engineering design documentation, virtual site visits were conducted to assess the existing facility. Integrating the 3D model with the pipelines, bathymetry data of the proposed pipeline routes and subsurface data, the team was able to design and engineer future upgrades required for the upcoming development. Furthermore, DT was used to visualize the proposed well paths, platform design, rig access and subsurface reservoir data which supported platform location, layout, and orientation decisions. The full project scope, in the form of a complete 3D model was created for both onshore and offshore assets. DT allowed the teams to have a better understanding of the site layout and area constraints that would have been impossible to envisage using 2D drawings alone. The proposed models assisted with identifying possible design issues, thus reducing the likelihood of errors and lowering costs associated with rework and corrections. The teams used high-resolution photogrammetry to support the environmental team in determining the best landing site for the pipeline and fiber optic cable. This was done by navigating through bathymetry and geohazards to land the new pipeline route from the platform to Beachfield. Overall, access to a digital representation of the facilities, led to a significant manhour saving for the teams, enabling integrated, efficient working and improved decision quality. Overall, the use of the DT has been estimated to deliver direct cost savings of several millions per year and generate double digits millions of indirect value from safety design and rework during project decision gates handover and project schedule integration. Furthermore, given the limitations due to the pandemic, CO2 emissions and the carbon footprint were lowered as there was a reduced number of helicopter flights offshore and drives towards the onshore facilities.

The traditional underwater structure damage detection of jackets had fewer measuring points, and was difficult, expensive, and might not predict the states of the platform structures. A jacket platform structure monitoring system was developed in the South China Sea. The system mainly included marine wind and wave environmental monitoring and platform structural vibrations and strain response monitoring. According to the monitoring data, a digital twin of the active jacket platform structures was proposed based on the dual finite element model modification. The safety assessment and life prediction models of the platform structures were modified through the digital twin technology to grasp the structural behaviors of the offshore jacket platform structures during the entire service cycle.

	abstract = {The onset of electrification and increasing penetration of renewable energy resources as well as prioritization for greater environmental, social and governance factors in the offshore energy sector will lead to the emergence of disruptive technologies. The offshore inspection, repair and maintenance (IRM) market was USD 8.93 billion in 2020 and is projected to grow to USD 18.04 billion by 2028 [1]. At present, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) generally supported with large offshore support vessels (OSVs), have established themselves as indispensable for offshore IRM operations. Key emerging technologies such as 3D computer vision, mixed reality, digital twinning, and machine learning, coupled with significant advances in robotics, automation, sensors, and communication now make it possible to consider performing a range of undersea tasks using undersea vehicles without a tether, but under careful human supervision. It is now possible to radically redefine the meaning of the words "tethered system" through a hybrid approach by including virtual tethering via high frequency acoustic or optical communication at a short range, and with an extremely small optical fiber base station providing remote surface connectivity. By collaborating with an onshore/offshore remote human operator and a digital twin of the environment, battery-powered, tetherless hybrid underwater vehicles (HUVs) will be able to perform a range of tasks at a remote location that might otherwise require a conventional ROV and a support ship on site. The Collaborative Human Robot Inspection & Intervention System (CHRIIS) is aimed towards providing remote intelligent tetherless solutions to inspection and light intervention of offshore marine assets. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {TotalEnergies' use of robotics on remote or offshore sites is considered with the objective of enabling unmanned operation for long periods and as the next frontier for increased personnel safety, industry attractiveness for young talents and further OPEX and CAPEX reduction. TotalEnergies performed several IT/OT system architecture evolutions and developed a specific Robot Supervision System (RSS) equivalent to a fleet management system to help and consolidate know-how in the deployments of specific mobile ground robots. As the first autonomous and explosion-proof inspection ground robots become commercial, many have difficulties seeing how these new devices can be interfaced with legacy industrial systems and how its data can be represented in a user-friendly interface to make the remote operation of robot efficient & attractive enough. Only this level of interfacing will enable the possibility for automated inspection, operation, and maintenance tasks execution with intuitive programmable interfaces. The robotic devices also need also to comply with detailed specifications in order to communicate its data in real time to the supervision system. We will describe the specific modifications required to the robot associated systems to be used within a private industrial network and the specification for real time interfacing of its data. Many Robot suppliers initiated their system developments focusing on robot navigation but a lot of the interfacing complexity with operator companies remained to be achieved to exchange data with the site digital twin, the maintenance task planning tool, the cloud machine learning software resources, or the Process Data Management System (PDMS) or even the plant control system (DCS). The associated functionalities of the RSS will also be presented: • Acquisition, historization and user-friendly display of robot's data • Integrate several robot types or from several vendors • Interface with all company systems • Visual 3D digital twin environment to display data acquired by the robot or useful data for its remote operation • Intuitive configuration and management of robot for routine tasks or based on a specific plant event or alarm • Comply with specific industrial cybersecurity rules Feedback will also be given on how it has been possible to adapt the IT architectures and how we intend to fit the requirements of OT systems to adopt robots with more critical interactions with the industrial process. We can present our approach for upscaling robot deployment with this on-premises supervision systems capable of historizing the data, generating immersive front-end displays for robots' operators and managing secured interconnections to corporate systems.

	abstract = {Accidents play an important role in the oil and gas industry because, among other consequences, they redefine definitions of safety. One of them is the Macondo accident, which happened in 2010 and changed the industry dramatically in terms of well safety and integrity. This work provides a literature review of well safety and integrity, divided into three eras: “the past” (pre-Macondo), “the present” (post-Macondo), and “the future” (digitalization and carbon neutrality). Our goal is to highlight the changes that the industry has undergone due to this event but also due to recent trends such as digitalization and carbon neutrality. The introduction contains a glossary of relevant definitions that are widely used in these subjects. The past reviews well integrity systems that companies had before the Macondo accident, illustrating their deficiencies compared to current systems. We also present available regulations, standards, and guidelines and what changed in them due to the accident. The present reviews current well integrity management systems (WIMS), their architectures, and studies of selected well barrier elements (fluid, BOP, wellhead, rock, and primary cementing). Finally, the future reviews ongoing trends such as the use of digitalization (through digital twins) to monitor and assess well integrity and the deployment of CCUS (carbon capture, utilization, and storage) wells to achieve carbon neutrality. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

It includes the participation of many disciplines and areas of knowledge, the integration of many technologies, both mature and emerging, but working in collaboration and relying on their study and implementation under the novel criteria of cyber-physical systems, provide solutions for the development and improvement of the industry. This study started with an exhaustive search for scientific information that allowed us to abstract the concept and reorganize the industry 4.0 paradigms to define a solid starting point. Finally, in this work we present two proposals for schematic analysis of Industry 4.0 that will help academia and other companies that need to start similar studies. The results will allow us to perform an alternative, more objective and technical analysis, and to know the functions and scope of the integrating technologies, to achieve a better collaboration of each area of knowledge and each professional, considering the potential, scope and limitations of each one.

Our DT aims at: i) avoiding over- or under-designing the system; ii) extrapolating from one system to a fleet of systems; and iii) estimating the costs of our offshore operations. These costs are evaluated as cost per kilogram of extracted plastic which is our Key Performance Indicator (KPI). One of the main contributing parameters to the KPI is the hydrodynamic load of our "U-shape" device that spans up to 630 meters and operates at a Speed Through Water (STW or ustw) up to 1.5 m/s equivalent to a twine Reynolds number of Ret∗ = 1600. The DT is built with OrcaFlex (OF) using lines and links, the Naumov’s drag correlation and on a no-wave assumption. Data collected from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) are utilised to increase the accuracy of our DT for estimating the loads and the system’s dynamic deformation. The DT is built using a three-cycle validation: i) initial guess applying the Naumov’s semi-empirical drag correlation to define OF drag coefficients which is excluding the influence of the local angles of attack (AoAs); ii) calibration of the OF drag coefficients using AquaSim (AS) with its twine-by-twine drag correlation for various AoAs; iii) recalibration of the OF drag coefficients from two-dimensional CFD simulations using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) for a twine-by-twine establishment of a drag correlation on a one meter segment plane net to account for shielding effects at AoA < 24◦. By doing so, we decrease the discrepancy of our OF model, on large spans, with an error less than 15% compared to the GPGP data. For a narrow span, mostly exhibiting very low AoAs, the first cycle shows a 300% discrepancy whereas at the end of the third cycle it shows a 50% discrepancy. Copyright © 2023 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Accurate understanding of the physics of the wellbore and knowledge of production rates are essential as they serve as a key input to modelling and therefore affect results and the decisions made based on those. This paper presents a methodology to create a physical representation of the wellbore and to compute production rates from monitoring parameters utilizing physics-rooted models. When connected to real-time measurements, the process enables continuous production surveillance and integration into a digital oilfield solution. The approach is validated against data from literature and a real North Sea offshore field. This work consists of an integrated methodology using a mechanistic approach to replicate the physics of the wellbore. The process utilizes transient heat transfer calculation between a deviated wellbore and formation. Black oil models are used to determine the properties of the produced fluids, which may comprise mixtures of gas/oil/water. Basic fluid properties and static information including wellbore design are required for the initial model setup. The dynamic input comprises choke downstream pressure, choke valve setting, pressure and temperature at wellhead and downhole. Dynamic data may come from either SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) for near real-time calculation, or manual readings. The methodology is validated with two quality data points from various fields used by other authors such as (Hasan & Kabir, Fluid Flow and Heat Transfer in Wellbores, 2002), including an onshore and an offshore well. Moreover, the process is also tested against the publicly available historical dataset of the Norwegian offshore field Volve, which was in production from 2008 to 2016. This allows simulation of daily production rates throughout entire well life cycles. The simulation of the real field cases achieves an average error MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) of 11.75 % for the liquid rate. The novelty of this approach is the ability to run a digital twin of a wellbore based on data that is already acquired as part of standard well monitoring operations. production allocation and quality control (QC) physical MPFM (multiphase flowmeter). Having such a model-based approach offers significant potential for cost savings, for instance reducing OPEX (operating expenditure) by stretching physical metering cycles and lowering CAPEX (capital expenditures) by saving metering infrastructure. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

Both fully data-driven models and hybrid models based on residual modelling are explored. We find that speed-ups on the order of 10k are achievable while keeping root mean squared error at less than 1%. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of developing OTSG surrogate models suitable for real-time operational optimization in a digital twin context.

	abstract = {During the early stages of the Covid pandemic, the oil and gas industry was faced with significant challenges in executing inspections for ageing offshore oil and gas infrastructure together with the management of various operational integrity threats. These challenges were addressed through the collaborative development of remote, digital techniques to minimise inspector time offshore and maximise efficiency. This initially involved a review and challenge of our existing operational integrity management lifecycle, comprising systems data, risk-based strategy development, inspection planning, inspection execution, data management, anomaly management (including fabric maintenance and engineering repairs) and closeout. Working with our partner, GDi, we sought to drive a step change into digital integrity management, combined with streamlined workflows, activities, and administrative tasks. The pilot development involved comprehensive laser scanning of a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) facility to generate a dimensionally accurate digital twin, overlayed with 360° HD photogrammetry to provide a thorough baseline for subsequent general visual inspections of pressure equipment, piping systems and structural elements. General visual inspections can now be executed remotely, without the requirement for an offshore inspector. The digital twin environment also supported transformation of inspector-led activities, through optimisation of processes, digital inspection workflows via tablets and seamless integration with the integrity management platform. The pilot development also involved enhancing the anomaly risk management process, including management of mitigations (such as temporary repairs) and actions required to resolve and close anomalies. For the anomaly actions, the digital twin environment enables the accurate estimation of fabric maintenance scopes and dimensionally accurate repairs for corrective work orders. The system also facilitates a unique overview of cumulative risk via the plotting of anomalies in the digital twin space. The digitally enhanced operational integrity management system has substantially reduced direct costs and personnel safety risks, enabled substantial improvements in productivity (up to 200% for inspections), and improved the quality of integrity management outcomes.

	abstract = {The paper describes a sensor fusion method that provides reliable, uninterrupted and bias-free estimates of the top tension in a mooring line. The method exploits the geometric nonlinearity of mooring systems installed in shallow to moderate water depths: a change of line length (due to winching) affects the local dynamic stiffness of the mooring line. Based on measurements of fairlead displacements and of the dynamic part of the top tension, the line length and true (unbiased) mean tension can be inferred. The method combines the use of (1) a classical kinematic observer to derive fairlead motions, (2) the compression of the recent history of fairlead motions to a few parameters, (3) a bank of neural networks, each network modelling the response corresponding to a given line length/static tension, and (4) a heuristic approach to selecting the most promising model among the candidates. One major advantage of the method is its sparsity, making it computationally efficient so it can be applied both offline, on large sets of recorded historical data, and online running on lightweight embedded hardware. The paper presents in detail each component listed above, and the method as a whole is verified on a realistic case. Given that enough excitation is present, the estimator was found to converge towards the true value of the tension, and to cope well with transient conditions such as winching operations, and with the presence of oceanic current. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The Company assets average life span have reached 50 years. Which over such a long period creates challenges in maintaining the information changes during the plant life cycle, the change in terminology, formats, standards, and systems. According to today's digital twin and operational excellence mandates, it is required to manage and represent the physical asset information. For that, the company implemented state of the art technology, which is intelligent, open and scalable data-model. This technology is based on web ontology, and it defines the formal naming, types, properties, and interrelationships of entities that fundamentally exist to represent the physical asset information during the asset life cycle from concept and design to operate stage. The objective of this paper is to share ADNOC Offshore experience, challenges and the benefits gained by implementing asset information Class Library, and the Reference Data Library as aligned with ISO15926 that is known as Data-Model, which describes the engineering Tags classification networks and ultimately represents the physical assets intelligent data and attributes. The data-model fundamentally is based on entities > relationships > values formula, where entities can lead to various values with unlimited relationships allowing any solution to quickly identify all related data in real-time. The formulas allow automatic extraction and identification of entities to facilitate the recognition and associations. This data management approach depends on Ontologies that are a formal way to describe taxonomies, essentially defining the structure of data, where it can be fully utilized to build the digital assets knowledge. Thus, the solution is designed to be flexible and allow reading from various data sources, which enriched the digital assets information and provided business, operations and integrity values. The challenges came from the rapidly growing Data, the newly engaged young engineers, and the demand for new digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, which is adding another layer of complexity. In the recent years, it has proven that this data model is expandable, agile and able to accommodate both small and large variances from projects and changes in standards into one consolidated master model. This in turn acts as the core of enterprise Digital Twin, which provide end users with a unified experience in accessing engineering and operation data. Ontologies are meant to represent information widely and are expected to be evolving frequently based on technical and business requirements in flexible manner and easy to maintain. Unlike the conventional data-models, which is based on database and class hierarchy representing structured data that evolve slowly with complicated constraints. Whereas, with the implemented data-model we were able to add new data sources and classes instantly to represent information for an operation business case.

	abstract = {The digital twinning is an important aspect of the evolving vessel management systems to reduce fuel consumption and predict operational parameters along the cruise route. Although the digital twinning of the vessels heavily operates on “pre-loaded” resistance data and engine parameters, it is becoming more important to generate real-time hydrodynamic & aerodynamic resistance data during cruising, with incoming weather, sea current and vessel trim/damage floating conditions along the route. For this purpose, the author aimed to develop a faster CFD methodology & algorithm to calculate the hydrodynamic & aerodynamic resistances, and then send the output to the digital twinning software of the vessel. The author aimed to develop a CFD code and algorithm that can be embedded to any Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) or Vessel Management Software to generate the resistance data in real time. The complexity of grid generation for RANSE calculations requires high density computer resources which increases the response time of the CFD software and the data flow. The other complexity is the adaptation of the “live cruise parameters” to the CFD software which significantly increases the calculation time. Although most programs focus on hydrodynamic calculation, with the implementation of this algorithm, both aerodynamic and hydrodynamic resistances of the vessel can be calculated at the same time.

	abstract = {Unlocking the value of product data for the subsea industry is essential to improving efficiency and sustainability from early engagement to fabrication, installation and throughout the product life cycle. Unlike standard flowlines managed with temperature sensors on trees which provide limited information to the operator, Ærfugl Project implemented distributed flowline temperature monitoring, to allow effective mitigation against hydrate formation utilising active heating technology. The case study was a collaborative effort between the project's subsea umbilical, riser and flowline (SURF) Contractor (hereafter referred to as the COMPANY) and its subsidiaries, with support from the owner and operator of the Ærfugl development (hereafter referred to as the CLIENT). A pre-existing Alliance between the two companies worked to turn live project data into operationally valuable insights. The case study capitalised on monitored temperature data from the COMPANY's first functional 20km electrically heat-traced flowline (hereafter referred to as the PRODUCT). The PRODUCT is a subsea pipein-pipe system with electrical heating wires and fibre optics laid in the annulus. The fibres provide a temperature reading every metre along the flowline length via distributed temperature sensing (DTS). The DTS topside interrogator collects, processes and stores the data offshore, simultaneously visualising it for the offshore operator. The case study successfully extended offshore data acquisition to the cloud, further processing the data onshore to produce valuable outputs visualised on cloud-based dashboards. In collaboration with the operator, offshore data acquisition was successfully performed using Open Platform Communication Direct Access protocol, all the while maintaining the required cyber security. The data was then processed and correlated to the flowline design parameters to monitor and create temperature visuals, report thermal insulation efficiency, hence, aiding flow assurance and operations. Data is processed and visualised on dashboards within the COMPANY's bespoke digital delivery interface (hereafter referred to as the DATA INTERFACE) – a cloud-based platform where all stakeholders have a common integrated interface – showing status, profiles, trends, warnings, alarms, and operator recommendations where applicable. associated carbon emissions). More broadly, value is created by reducing unplanned production downtime, limiting (mono-ethylene glycol) MEG injection and flaring, validating and expanding operational envelopes by reducing design envelope conservatism, and allowing Subject Matter Expert-assessed, automated reporting. Furthermore, production and integrity envelopes through the product life cycle can be inherently validated, providing invaluable feedback and insight. Geared with such knowledge, conservatism in design may be reduced, system usage is improved and adjusted as the system ages and project delivery is enhanced. This paper highlights the value of useful data creation and processing resulting from constant monitoring of smart flowlines, allowing for improved product operation and development, building towards an actionable digital twin. Relying on a collaborative approach, a comprehensive field data management strategy highlights a critical tool and a repeatable/scalable process to provide value, supporting sustainability and efficient asset lifecycle management. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {As part of the digitalization and utilization of Automated Monitoring during drilling operations, real-time dynamic modelling of downhole combined with 3D dynamic visualization have been implemented on the drillfloor in offshore rigs. The objectives have been to give the driller instant feedback on the ECD and other effects of the operations and allow for a safer and smoother operation within the limits of the well. The basic elements of this technology are i. A digital twin of the well with all relevant data and properties included. ii. A set of integrated transient models (hydraulics, surge & swab, displacement, mechanical friction). These models are driven by the RT data from operation and compute critical safety parameters which are presented for the driller. iii. A diagnostic module analyzing differences between measured and modelled parameters and trends. iv. A 3D Virtual Well which visualize the downhole well, the risk matrix, the diagnostics and messages as well as the ECDs at critical positions in the well. The 3D System has been utilized during drilling of several very challenging ERD and Multi-Lateral wells on two platforms in the North Sea. The system was also used during tripping in and out of the well, and during running of casing and liners. During these operations there is no PWD data available, and the modelled ECD values proved especially useful. The Trip-risk log from the Geologist was included in the 3D View during these operations, and the Driller could then see on the 3D when a risk was coming up. This paper will present the experiences from using the dynamic 3D & modelling system on several wells. The feedback from the Drillers and Drilling manager have been positive, and the results are very promising. © 2020 Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE). All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Ship motion has significant effects on certain maritime applications like offshore crane operation. In particular, the vertical heave motion is undesired for safe transferring, accurate positioning and subsea installation. In recent years, there have been growing tasks in utilizing ship motion data for online operation improvement based on the development of virtual simulation environment, digital twin and automatic remote-control systems. How to effectively utilize ship motion data is fundamental to these tasks. This paper presents a neural-network-based method to predict ship motion and use the prediction to improve active heave compensation (AHC) of offshore crane operation. A virtual prototype of the lifting system is developed including implementation of the proposed AHC algorithms. A multilayer perceptron model is trained to predict ship motion. By feeding the future motion of the ship into the controller, the lifting performance can be tested in the virtual environment and the result can be applied to its counterpart. Through simulation with measured sensor data, the proposed method is verified efficient in improving crane operation performance. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The development of an accurate digital performance twin of a tug requires a complete understanding of its propulsive capacity and hull-thruster interactions. In this study, the propulsion characteristics of an Azimuth Stern Drive (ASD) tug is investigated using model-scale Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations. The propulsion plant consists of two counter-rotating thruster units, with each having a Ka4-70 series propeller and 19A duct profile. Comparisons in propulsive performances using the steady-state moving reference frame (MRF) approach and the transient rigid body motion (RBM) models are shown, and validated against data from openwater experiments. The MRF method gives sufficiently accurate predictions of thrust and torque in forward flow and moderate angles-of-attack, while the RBM method performs better at larger inflow angles. The effects of thruster-hull and thruster-thruster interactions on wake characteristics and propulsion performance are also investigated over a range of advance and inflow/azimuth angles. Convergence and mesh independence studies are conducted to determine the optimal spatial and temporal simulation parameters. Results from this study identify flow regimes where hull and thruster interactions are significant. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {During the production phase of the PW1 well, an unintentional operation depressurized the annulus A belowits design limit, causing a progressive casing collapse from the surface casing to the tubing string, resulting ina well failure and a subsequent an abandonment operation. This event was detailed in a previous publication(Campos et al., 2019). After a detailed investigation of the events that drove the well failure and usingcasing design software to simulate the well behavior with the historical time series data, it was possible toidentify the exact moment of the casings collapse through mathematical modelling. Based on that, considering innovation as critical success factor (Rocha, 2012), PETROBRAS startedan R&D project to evaluate, in real time, critical integrity events during production phase. The approachproposed consists on the integration of a transient fluid flow model (Bonizzi, 2003) and (Bonizzi, Andreussiand Banerjee, 2009) with a structural model (Araújo et al., 2019) of the well and loads being calculatedin real time as a function of the production data (PDG's, X-TREE and Topside). The process describedwas named as Well Integrity Surveillance (WIS) and its being designed to work 24/7 in a collaborativeenvironment, integrating well handover information, inspections and intervention reports, production dataand flow modeling. The objective of this paper is to present the well integrity case study of a deep-water field in the Braziliancoast, through a real time digital twin approach, highlighting the main technological solutions, developedto ensure the assets operational envelope, during its lifetime. With the well integrity surveillance digital twin, PETROBRAS successfully implemented a pilot projecton three offshore production units in Brazil, increasing the knowledge of the well structural behavior andconsequentially the assets operational safety during its lifetime. © 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the simulation and key link characterization of the complex assembly model step-down process are studied and analysed in depth using the digital twin approach, and the method is used in the practical process. The physical model step-down method MORA algorithm and its physical interpretation in various simplified cases are given, and the MORA method is improved on this basis. The concept of local activeness based on knot structure is introduced, and the process of model transformation and downscaling and decomposition based on local activeness is explained in detail. The high-fidelity mapping of solid equipment is completed in virtual space, which can accurately reproduce and predict the health state of engineering equipment throughout its life cycle, effectively avoiding the huge property losses and safety risks caused by early failure of vulnerable structures and providing a safe and stable working environment for offshore oil and gas production. With the prototype monitoring data as reference, the response surface method is used to identify the parameters of the finite element model of the hinge node, which improves the fidelity of the virtual model of the hinge node. Considering the friction coefficient changes and load characteristics during the degradation of the hinge node, the dynamics simulation conditions are set, and the operating states of the hinge node at different stages of its whole life cycle are simulated by using the high-fidelity virtual model of the hinge node, and the prediction model of the hot spot stress of the hinge node is established to monitor its in-position state in real time, and the operation and maintenance overhaul method based on the health state of the hinge node is proposed. The system is divided into four modules: multilevel inverse modelling of the assembly twin, statistical shape characterization and analysis of batch parts, optimization of fixture positioning and flexible assembly of thin-walled parts, and optimization of low-stress assembly of bolted joint structure, which verifies the feasibility of the method and provides guidance for the actual product forming process.  © 2021 Zhuqiao Ma et al.},

An evolving approach is the integration of power and process systems throughout the lifecycle of the plant, commencing at the plant design phase and progressing to the operational stage. The improved operational efficiency brought up by integrated power and process control systems through greater situational awareness, improved reliability, and faster troubleshooting extends the value of this integrated approach to operations & maintenance lifecycle.

	abstract = {We have conducted research with 50 E&P companies to identify the emerging technologies that would have the potential to disrupt oil and gas industry in the next three to five years. Examples of these technologies include: Aerial Data Gathering & Interpretations, Artificial Intelligence including Machine & Deep Learning, Biosciences including DNA Sequencing CRISPR Editing, Blockchain, Micro fluidics, Digital Twin 2.0., Nanotechnology, Natural Language Processing, Quantum Computing, and 3D Printing. The scope of this research will include identification of those disrupting technologies, field level tactical applications of those technologies and use cases, the potential impact of those technologies voted by the 50 operators, and required conditions for top selected technologies to flourish. In this paper we will not review an individual technology to utmost technical depth but we will provide a portfolio view of emerging technologies and their level of impact on the industry. The foresight into the future technological disruptions is critical for the E&P companies who are investing millions of dollars each year in upgrading their equipment and infrastructure. Without this foresight, much of their investments could rapidly become obsolete. Our approach involved deep interviews with subject matter experts within 50 oil companies to collect a database of interests and needs by them. Then we investigated more than 150 technology innovators and startups to identify disruptive solutions that could match those particular needs of the operators. Finally, we brought the top selected technologies in touch with the operators in a one full day workshop to high-grade and discuss the implications. We have reviewed 20 technology trends that have the potential to be disruptive and found out that 5 of these technology trends attracted and were viewed as top areas for disruption by 80% of the operators. We also found out that a few of these technology themes are more fundamental and the enablers for the broader set of disruptions to happen, while a number of them are more secondary or consequential. Up to this date all research on frontier technologies that could have an impact on oil and gas industry have been studied academically and/or by industry on a one by one basis. This paper for the first time collects a statistically valid interpretation on the importance of these technologies by the resource holders themselves and takes a portfolio view on emerging technologies versus the silo view that makes it difficult to prioritize resources and technology roadmaps. This will benefit all stakeholders of the oil and gas industry ranging from operators, innovators, investors, and to the resource holder nations in large. © Copyright 2019, Offshore Technology Conference},

	abstract = {Multiphase flow meters are often built based on one or many single-phase flow metering technologies.Following the trend, Coriolis meters are being increasingly used in upstream applications in conjunctionwith an independent water cut meter to measure multiphase flow. Coriolis meters are well-known for fiscalmetering applications as they offer unparalleled accuracy without having to input detailed information onthe fluid being metered. They offer two distinct measurements: Density, and mass flow rate, which is oftennot possible with other metering technologies. Subsequently, under multiphase flow, the biggest problemwith liquid Coriolis meters is their tendency to stall when large amounts of gas flows through them. Manymanufacturers over the last 10 years have developed techniques to adjust the drive gain to enhance the abilityof these meters to handle increasing amounts of gas. There have also been several developments in usingadvanced signal processing and machine learning methods to help the meters to self-calibrate and correctfor the presence of gas. These methods range from a simple error analysis on certain raw measurements tomore sophisticated "Digital Twin" based concepts to simulate the behavior of the Coriolis meter internally.The paper describes the concept of "Digital Twin" in detail and outlines the reasons for the superiority ofsuch an approach. © 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the challenges of creating a reliable and accurate as-operated digital twin for abrownfield process plant. Besides massive amounts of information spread over silos, there is so-called "darkdata", which is a type of unstructured/untagged data in different formats: 1D (datasheets, lists, records), 2D(drawings, logical connectivity), 3D (physical layout, sizes). This paper describes an approach/solution thatmakes it possible to validate, connect and make use of this data. The solution described in this paper was developed collaboratively between Siemens and BentleySystems. Using a combination of tools and experience from both companies, it is now possible to leveragetraditionally inaccessible data to create a single digital twin. The paper will not focus on the solution itself,but rather the process and steps that operators can employ to aggregate, contextualize, validate, and visualizetheir data so that it can be used to make quicker/more informed decisions. The solution is an open, cloud-based platform that federates data sources, provides functionalities in theform of microservices, and facilitates the management of the digital twin of the asset, throughout its entirelifecycle. The solution was built as a set of microservices including collaborative process engineering andfunctional asset information management (i.e., 1D information such as specifications and data sheets and2D schematics), and 3D design and physical asset modeling. It also contains information management fromasset and project management perspectives, including maintenance history, reliability data, and failure modeanalyses as well as analytics services and the capability to trace back versions. Many functionalities drawon software that has been used extensively across process industry for many years. The user is able to use pre-existing 3D plant models or projects authored in most available 3D designtools and mix and match those with models based on photogrammetry or 3D point clouds to create a "realitymesh." The portal accommodates the need for an up-to-date version of accurate asset data, which is criticalto making the correct maintenance-related and operational decisions quickly as well as the requirement forhistorical snapshots (essential to engineering purposes and project progress reviews). This approach is key in that it enables O&G operators to solve the challenge of creating a digital twinwithout disruption to the existing physical or virtual environment. Combining 1D, 2D, and 3D in a singleenvironment provides functional context to physical representations and vice versa. The more "dark data"that can be made visible, tagged, validated, and linked to other information, the more valuable and context-rich information will become. © 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {The new regulations regarding ship emissions based on IMO regulations combined to the high fuel prices require the application of new technologies to improve ship efficiency and to reduce the CO2, NOX, SOX and BC emissions. The application of LNG as fuel and battery packs to improve the conventional engines performance are already a reality in offshore supply vessels (OSV) around the world. However, the reduction in OPEX and payback time of the additional investment is very dependent of the ship operational profile, which are related to the FPSOs and port facilities particularities in Brazil. In order to estimate the advantages of these technologies in the PSV overall performance several different simulators regarding DP operation, sailing, waiting and anchored mode are combined to obtain a digital twin of the vessel. These simulators are combined to the real data monitored from the ships regarding ship speed, position and heading collected in Brazil based on AIS/AIS-Sat database. This database is combined to the environmental conditions regarding wave, current and wind obtained based on global numerical models to provide the environmental loads acting in the ship during the different stages of the operation. The DP simulations are performed applying a thrust allocation algorithm, the calm water resistance is obtained based on regression models and the added resistance due to waves are computed based on strip theory. The forces are converted into electric load by considering the propeller, generators, switchboard, electric drive and engine efficiency curves combined to a power management system (PMS) algorithm, which balance the loads in the engines according to the operational mode. The baseline for comparison is the current PSV without dual-fuel engines or battery pack. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Plate anchor technology is an efficient solution for mooring offshore floating facilities for oil and gas or renewable energy projects. When used with a taut mooring, the anchor is typically subjected to a maintained load component and intermittent episodes of cyclic loading throughout the design life. These loads, and the associated shearing, remoulding and consolidation processes, cause changes in the anchor capacity, particularly in soft, fine-grained soils. The changing anchor capacity affects the mooring performance by changing the safety margin and also the overall system reliability. In this paper the changing anchor capacity in reconstituted, normally consolidated natural carbonate silt was assessed through a series of beam centrifuge tests on horizontally loaded circular plate anchors. The results demonstrate that full consolidation under a typical maintained load leads to a 50% gain in the anchor capacity, and subsequent cyclic loading and reconsolidation can triple this increase. An effective stress framework based on critical state concepts is employed to explain and support the experimental observations. This study shows that, when viewed from a whole-life reliability perspective, maintained and cyclic loading provide a long-term enhancement of anchor capacity in soft, fine-grained soils. This beneficial effect is currently overlooked in design practice, but can be predicted using the framework shown here, which can form the basis for a digital twin that monitors the through-life integrity of a plate anchor.  © 2019 },

Furthermore, the design team had to considerably reduce its power consumption and weight in comparison to existing solutions. Finally, the system was designed for lean manufacturing, allowing considerable cost-saving benefits for all the partners due to extensive standardization work.

	abstract = {Human exposure is a relevant factor when operating in critical environments and depends on a thorough analysis and consideration towards driving the teams to a safer and more productive environment. Reducing such exposure through digital technologies benefits the whole workforce in their decisions and maneuvers, like simulations, training, and other critical activities that can be executed remotely and prior to the actual activity. This paper presents a case study to demonstrate how augmented and virtual reality can be used to create a high fidelity virtual environment emulating the real industrial facility. This approach enriches the Digital Twin with the association of data and the virtual environment. It leverages on display and interaction capabilities of hardware devices, and intelligence and data querying capabilities of industrial software, empowering the workers with enhanced training capabilities and access to information increasing safety and efficiency. A real application of this technology is presented in this paper through the case study of the PredictMain4.0 project of Repsol Sinopec Brazil (RSB), which aimed at the integration of digital technologies, including augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). The PredictMain4.0 project was executed using data and data models of PETROBRAS’ P-50, a FPSO (Floating Production Storage and Offloading) operating in Brazil, and illustrates how different AR/VR applications can be developed and used in combination with engineering, operation, and maintenance databases. This includes 3D models, digitalized critical procedures, and the ability to integrate field teams into a single virtual environment, allowing real interaction in a digital setting that is linked to the real world. Considering the digitalized procedures, this paper aims to establish how virtual simulation and training can make teams more confident and prepared to execute the same physical asset procedures. After consulting with stakeholders from many different teams, the PredictMain4.0 project team selected three critical operating modules in the FPSO (Power Generation, Water Injection, and Gas Compression). For each one, considered which situations were relevant, should they occur. These situations led to developing a training and simulation framework, allowing instructors to create different scenarios and use advanced features such as digital measurement, real-time data collection, and collaborative sessions. The case study indicates that the development of such applications can save more than $1 million per year in maintenance costs considering the decrease in downtime and avoiding risks of accident. © 2021, Offshore Technology Conference.

	abstract = {Building a digital oil-field or digital twin, without involving multiple digital partners, and costly time-consuming digital endeavor is a significant challenge in Oil & Gas industry. In most cases, such systems arecapable of data integration and visualization for only a part of an oil-field. Real-time analytics is missing totransform the digitalization into a smart and scalable system. The objective of this paper is to present a digitaloil-field creator driven by a computational framework to perform key analytics for oil-field life cycles. A computational framework, networked with decentralized analytics engines that are equipped witha predictive analytics computation system, and an automated design engineering system has beendeveloped. The predictive analytics computation system performs engineering design using data, pipelineintegrity, platform structures, and coupled systems integrity and equipment integrity. The automateddesign engineering engine performs conceptual and FEED for subsea elements such as pipelines. Thesecomputational engines are then integrated into a self-service 3D digital twin creator for the user to operateon the front end and to receive analytical insights. 3D digital twin creator is capable of creating oil-field architecture within a fraction of the time utilizingthe traditional model. Additionally, the creator optimizes the subsea architecture based on a selected set ofcriteria including CAPEX or OPEX costs. The system then performs conceptual or FEED level engineeringincluding finite element analysis (FEA) using automated engineering saving as much as 80% of engineeringtime. Finally, the digital model is able to conduct asset integrity predictive analytics using machine learningfrom the monitored data. A Gulf of Mexico (GOM) oil field concept architecture was created by the digitaltwin creator and the computational framework. The system performed an automated pipeline conceptualoptimization, buckling and free span design, and finally conducted riser integrity and equipment integrity.The computational framework is flexible and scalable to incorporate any organization's existing engineeringprocess. The multidisciplinary complex analytics systems are networked in a way to maximize the integrationof multiple oil-field systems from multiple companies and their asset's operational status in a 3D visualwithout a complex or expensive digital system. This digital system not only integrates multiple phases ofthe oil-field life cycle but also allows the reuse of all processes across different projects and time. © 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {The presence of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) in produced reservoir fluids mandates precautions in the design and operation of the surface facilities. The toxicity and corrosive nature of H2S, and the need to prevent both plugging of reservoir formations and increasing the sulphur content of the produced oil dictates the criticality of forecasting and monitoring the volumes and concentrations of H2S flowing through the whole asset. Ensuring the concentration is within acceptable operational limits is critical to safeguard the overall asset and the integrity of the surface pipeline network. The objective of this study was to utilize a history matched Digital Twin Integrated Asset Model (IAM) to predict the volumes and concentrations of H2S in a field located offshore Abu Dhabi by modeling the multistage separation, H2S removal, and re-injection facilities for gas injection and gas lifts. The field consists of multiple stacked carbonate reservoirs sharing the same surface facilities. The proposed modelling of H2S removal strategy involved a series of steps beginning with the sweetening of the produced associated gas for fuel gas requirements and mixing the extracted H2S volumes with the gas injection and gas lift streams. The sweetening process effectively mitigated any potential asset integrity issues arising due to corrosion of the power generation system and other surface facility assets. The stripped H2S gas, re-combined with the remaining produced gas, was used for gas-lifts and reinjected into the lower reservoirs for pressure maintenance and enhanced oil recovery (EOR). A next-generation surface-subsurface coupled simulator was utilized for the modeling of this field including the full asset surface pipeline network, the H2S removal plant, bypass lines and re-injection facilities for gas injection and gas-lifts. The Digital Twin IAM approach provided a robust method for tracking and predicting the concentration and volume of H2S in the produced gas over a period of 50 years. The simulation allowed tracking the H2S from its initial location in the reservoirs, into the production wells, then through the pipelines, all the way to the surface facilities where the sweetening of the produced is handled. Moreover, the use of the Digital Twin allowed the verification of the disposal plan of the extracted H2S, showing that mixing it with the re-injection gas stream is a feasible option. Recommendations based on the model were provided to the production and facilities team, leading to a robust long-term field development plan that ensures asset integrity. © Copyright 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers},

	abstract = {Cranes on offshore vessels are subjected to crane dynamics, structural couplings to the vessel, and environmental influence by waves and currents. The recent trend has been to use larger cranes on smaller vessels, which makes the lifting operation more complex and potentially dangerous. The use of digital twins (DTs) is emerging as one way to enable safer operations, real-time simulation, and maintenance prediction. On offshore vessels, a DT can monitor the lifting operation to create a safer work environment. The SPADE (stakeholders, problem formulation, alternatives, decision making, and evaluation) model has been used as a framework toward the creation of a DT of cranes on offshore vessels. Several cases involving simulation of cranes revealed the lack of an adequate simulation of cable and pulleys suitable for use in a DT. The simulation is important for accurate results and for implementation in control systems. A trade study was performed to determine a numerical method adequate for cable and pulley simulation. The trade study identified the absolute nodal coordinate formulation in the framework of arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian as a promising numerical formulation. © 2019 The Authors.

This paper starts by setting out the main digital focus areas for the Johan Sverdrup development, butdrills down on exploring the areas where Johan Sverdrup is demonstrating real and tangible impacts alreadytoday. Examples include efforts to mature technology for automatic production optimization, a number ofnew pipe and seabed technology solutions (including fiber-optic PRM, fiber-optic monitoring of wells), andthe step-wise development of a digital twin for Johan Sverdrup that will gives the opportunity to model andvisualize key parts of the field.

	abstract = {Robotics is often referred to as an enabler towards safer and more cost-effective operations within the energy industry. However, for robots to achieve their full potential they too require their own enablers. This paper intends to present a collection of lessons learnt in robotic development to date that has resulted in the necessity to develop an encompassing digital architecture. This architecture, with an artificial intelligence component, has been designed to optimise both robot and digital twin capability, where the complete system is always working with the latest information available that reflects the ground truth. The architecture concept will be explained including why integration and standardisation are of paramount importance. The paper will also demonstrate how business value can be generated before fully explainable, transparent, verifiable autonomy is available for robotics to be deployed on future unmanned platforms that have been designed to optimise robot operation opposed to existing human engineered environments. All these topics are important within their own right, but all are also years away from adoption on an industrial scale. To ensure continued engagement until such a point is reached, the industry needs to focus more on the quick wins and immediate value that can be gained from robotics. The impact of COVID-19 has shown how quickly and effectively the energy industry has been able to transition to remote working. This represents a massive opportunity to prove what robotics can deliver via remote operation, minimizing vendors where possible. The concept of "full" autonomy will be discussed with respect to value generation and barrier to entry or adoption within the energy industry. The paper will address all practical considerations that have required attention to date plus explain the next programme of work in the evolving RAS (robotics and autonomous systems) digital architecture whilst ensuring complete integration with the data pipelines that have already been built. © 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers},

On this basis, an accurate digital modeling description of the actual physical process can be accomplished, so that the load can be optimized and scheduled more accurately. In this paper, a micro grid of oilfield platforms is taken as the research object. The load forecasting, fault analysis and power system optimization of offshore oilfield platforms is hard in traditional models. This paper uses the (phasor measurement unit) PMU for situation awareness and update actual time data thus the digital model can receive feedback from actual situation. A DT model based on data collected and uploaded by sensors and the PMU is proposed as a digital model on the cloud. On this basis, this loop forms an adaptive and self-learning system which can minimize the forecast error and obtain better optimization. The DT model can make the design and update of offshore oilfield platforms power system easier, as well as cut down the cost of optimization. © 2020 The Institution of Engineering and Technology},

	abstract = {The objective of the paper is to optimise the Steel Lazy Wave Riser configuration based on an analytical approach and implement the riser design automation in cloud-based digital subsea field. The methodology demonstrates the effective implementation of multi-objective optimisation methods based Genetic Algorithm (GA) and hybrid GA with Radial Basis Function(RBF). Steel Lazy Wave Riser (SLWR) configuration is considered for the riser design optimisation and automation. The configuration consists of multiple design variables such as top angle, sag bend elevation, hog bend elevation, length of the buoyancy section and the module diameter. The riser configuration optimisation is time-consuming and exhaustive method due to nonlinear time domain analysis and a large number of load cases. Therefore, a novel analytical optimisation technique is developed to reduce the computational cost as well as the complexity using automation. The riser design automation procedures consist of the following steps: 1. The multi-objective optimisation algorithm is used to find the optimal configuration of the riser systems in static condition 2. The optimised configurations in the static state are used for further optimisation based on fatigue and extreme load conditions. 3. Use the final optimal configuration for generating the orcaflex simulation file and perform the design automation in the cloud-based subsea digital field. The proposed optimisation and design automation method minimises both the maximum riser stress and the cumulative fatigue damage of the SLWR configurations. It also demonstrates the significant reduction in computational cost as well automation helps to reduce the standard error occurs due to manual inputs. The all necessary design data are received from the cloud-based field development and perform the calculation in the cloud. The whole procedures are presented in a very efficient and time-saving manner in cloud-based field platform. The traditional design of the riser configuration is very experience-dependent as well as very time-consuming. But the riser design optimisation using the optimisation algorithm based on GA can save considerable computational time and also less need for design experience.

	abstract = {Digital data collected by the oil and gas industry supports many, if not, most of its activities. Data integrity, security, mining, analysis, and transfer are critical to the industry. Related topics such as the use and management of massive data sets ("big data"), data value and ownership, cybersecurity, cloud computing, machine learning, and virtual twin modeling and simulation represent only a small subset of the derivative uses of digital data being contemplated by the industry. Why are they important for the O&G Industry? These are imperative discussion topics for the oil and gas industry because of the potential for significant improvements in safety, asset security and environmental stewardship. The opportunity for improvements in performance, availability, efficiency and profitability demonstrated in other industries holds promise for the oil and gas industry, as well. OTC is the world forum for revealing innovations, solutions, ideas, and emerging technologies. To continue this mission, an OTC program subcommittee was formed to organize panels over a three (3) year span to discuss these topics and their relevance to the oil and gas industry. A cohesive and coordinated approach sets the path to similar efforts that tackles other critical topics to increase the knowledge base and benefit from the experience accumulated in other industries, thus avoiding mishaps. The "Big Data" panels were populated by high level executives and technologists from all sectors such as: Operators, Service Companies, Equipment Manufacturers, EPC, and Academia. Each panel was built in three sequence stages: The first to raise awareness, the second to discuss challenges and successes, and thirdly to have an overview of success case studies and the future. The 17 panelists were requested to ponder and present their view of challenging topics: • What is the current level of maturity for data collection enablers (i.e., sensing, transmission, storage, transformation, and processing) in the industry? • Who "owns" data? How is ownership determined, protected, and transferred? • Once data has been collected and its ownership established, what we do with it? How do we extract knowledge and value from collected data to benefit the operations, gain efficiencies, and improve safety and security? What are the business propositions that sensed data collection, storage, and analysis bring to the table? • How much data is gathered? How much is repeatedly stored? How much collected data is transformed into actionable knowledge (data "yield")? At what level does a data set become "big data"? What makes big data useful and unique? • How important is data security? How securely data is handled now? How securely should it be handled? • How effectively data is analyzed? What data analysis methods and tools should the industry be adopting that aren't now being used? This paper will summarize the development of the topics and the answers to these questions providing valuable insights to the future of Big Data and Data Analytics for the Energy Industry, strategies being implemented by major energy players, and the role and actions needed to be taken by professional societies. © 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {Flow assurance is central to the design of a subsea production system and requires frequent interfacing with engineers from multiple disciplines. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate how cloud based digital field twin can be leveraged to automate subsea flow assurance engineering workflows and consequently, achieve efficient collaborations, faster and reliable designs, and reduced costs. In this proposed workflow, engineers use a web application built on top of a cloud-based digital twin platform to perform flow assurance calculations and design analysis. The web based platform integrates multiphase flow simulators and other relevant engineering tools through python scripts. A user is only required to input design constraints and necessary basic information. The application acquires interdisciplinary data (e.g. pipeline, layout, equipment, etc.) and automatically performs pre-processing, model setup, simulation, and results processing in the background and make results available to all the users at the front-end. The digital flow assurance platform replaces traditional workflows requiring use of different standalone engineering software, and frequent exchange of information with other engineering teams in form of documents and spreadsheets. The proposed cloud-based workflow allows engineers to focus on technical analysis by eliminating several manual and repeating processes such as accessing different software, creating models, results extraction and formatting, etc. The ability to share results in form of auto-generated reports and formatted spreadsheets; minimizes human errors and promotes information exchange and transparency among project team members from different disciplines. The cloud based platform enables engineers to work on a same project from different geophysical locations and devices. Overall, this digital flow assurance workflow significantly improves engineering efficiency, save costs, and allows faster and reliable concept design and FEED (Front End Engineering Design). The ideas widely discussed for flow assurance digitalization typically include use of data analytics and machine learning, virtual flow metering, real time data monitoring, predictive analytics, etc. This paper, however, presents novel practical idea to bring digital transformation to the way flow assurance engineers work and collaborate. © 2021, Offshore Technology Conference.

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to present a method for monitoring the natural frequency of a fixed offshore platform and to utilize the raw data to proactively monitor and predict structural degradation of the platform using machine learning. This can enable operators to predict critical member failure and guide timing of operational decisions and interventions, thus helping reduce cost of ownership, particularly for ageing assets. A Natural Frequency Response Monitoring (NFRM) system utilizes accelerometers and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to measure the sway and torsional frequencies of a fixed offshore platform. A significant structural event is detected by a shift in the natural response of the platform. A machine learning model (or digital twin) can be trained on this accelerometer data to replicate the platform response and determine the fatigue damage accumulation in platform members. The model, which can be re-trained to maintain accuracy, acts as a near real-time fatigue tracker with the NFRM system acting as a verification tool. A proof of concept case study is presented and demonstrates how Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations and measured data can be used to develop a machine learning model. The combination of an NFRM system with machine learning has the potential to assist operators in the prediction and identification of structural changes prior to them becoming critical. Knowledge of the actual fatigue damage in key platform members on a near real-time basis allows for proactive planning of inspections or repairs, as well as confidence in the structural performance of the platform, which can justify life extension. © 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers},

A major aspect is the prediction of the occurrence of a failure before the affected function is demanded. This is one purpose of the Condition Monitoring (CM), Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) and the application of a Digital Twin. The paper presents the result of an ability analysis for a subsea actuator towards its possibilities to increase the availability through a novel and extensive grade of information. The paper presents the resulting architecture and solution to achieve an actuator design, which is capable to provide a high safety, high reliability and a predictive health management which is prepared for a digital twin application. For this purpose, an applied Condition Monitoring concept is described and shown based on the case study. The analysis and resulting solution is based on a detailed research towards the state of the art. Different available subsea actuators are analyzed towards the communication interfaces and the ability to allow CM. Therefore, the required status and information of the actuator are shown (e.g. Torque, position, temperature, acceleration, water concentration in oil, humidity, pressure, inclinometer). The required environment information about the actuator are evaluated with the help of a failure mode analysis. The different sensor principles provide the necessary information. The paper evaluates the significance of the sensor information towards the CM concept. The data can be provided on different communication interfaces and protocols. These are analyzed towards the satisfaction of the CM requirements. The result of the analysis is a detailed architecture of a CM capable subsea electric actuator including the CM concept. The possible interfaces are shown and the provided sensor data by the actuator. The sensors provide the input for the CM model and the remote accessibility and controllability of the actuator. The result is the novel design of a subsea actuator, which fits perfect in a digitalized subsea environment to increase the availability and controllability including a CM concept. © 2021, Offshore Technology Conference.

Barriers to residential Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) autonomy as a service, include operational challenges in run-time safety compliance, reliability and resilience, due to the complexities of dealing with known and unknown risk in dynamic environments. In this paper we incorporate a Symbiotic System Of Systems Approach (SSOSA) that uses a Symbiotic Digital Architecture (SDA) to provide a cyber physical orchestration of enabling technologies. Implementing a SSOSA enables Cooperation, Collaboration and Corroboration (C3), as to address run-time verification of safety, reliability and resilience during autonomous missions. Our SDA provides a means to synchronize distributed digital models of the robot, environment and infrastructure. Through the coordinated bidirectional communication network of the SDA, the remote human operator has improved visibility and understanding of the mission profile. We evaluate our SSOSA in an asset inspection mission within a confined operating environment. Demonstrating the ability of our SSOSA to overcome safety, reliability and resilience challenges. The SDA supports lifecycle learning and co-evolution with knowledge sharing across the interconnected systems. Our results evaluate both sudden and gradual faults, as well as unknown events, that may jeopardize an autonomous mission. Using distributed and coordinated decision making, the SSOSA enhances the analysis of the mission status, which includes diagnostics of critical sub-systems within the resident robot. This evaluation demonstrates that the SSOSA provides enhanced run-time operational resilience and safety compliance to BVLOS autonomous missions. The SSOSA has the potential to be a highly transferable methodology to other mission scenarios and technologies, providing a pathway to implementing scalable autonomy as a service.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The development of supercomputing technologies has enabled a shift towards high-fidelity simulations that is used to complement physical modelling. At the Technology Centre for Offshore and Marine, Singapore (TCOMS), such simulations are used for high-resolution investigations into particular aspects of fluid-structure interactions in order to better understand and thereby predict the generation of important flow features or the complex hydrodynamic interactions between components onboard ships and floating structures. In addition, by building on the outputs of such simulations, data-driven models of actual physical systems are being developed, which in turn can be used as digital twins for real-time predictions of the behaviour and responses when subjected to complex real-world environmental loads. In this paper, examples of the high-resolution investigations, as well as the development of digital twins, are described and discussed. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Pipeline corrosion is a major identified threat in the offshore oil and gas industry. In this paper, a novel computer vision-based digital twin concept for real-time corrosion inspection is proposed. The Convolution Neural Network (CNN) algorithm is used for the automated corrosion identification and classification from the ROV images and In-Line Inspection data. Predictive and prescriptive maintenance strategies are recommended based on the corrosion assessment through the digital twin. A Deep-learning Image processing model is developed based on the pipeline inspection images and In-Line Inspection images from some previous inspection data sets. During the corrosion monitoring through pipeline inspection, the digital twin system would be able to gather data and, at the same time, process and analyze the collected data. The analyzed data can be used to classify the corrosion type and determine the actions to be taken (develop predictive and prescriptive maintenance strategy). Convolution Neural Network, a well known Deep Learning algorithm, is used in the Tensorflow framework with Keras in the backend is used in the digital twin for corrosion inspection. CNN algorithm will first detect the corrosion and then the type of corrosion based on image classification. The deep-learning network training is done using 4000 images taken from the inspection video frames from a subsea pipeline inspection using ROV. The performances of both the methods are compared based on result accuracy as well as processing time. Deep Learning algorithm, CNN has approximately 81% accuracy for correctly identifying the corrosion and classify them based on severity through image classification. The processing time for the deep-learning method is significantly faster, and the digital twin generates the predictive or prescriptive strategy based on the inspection result in real-time. Deep-learning based digital twin for Corrosion inspection significantly improve current corrosion identification and reduce the overall time for offshore inspection. The inspection data loss due to the communication interference during real-time assessment can be eliminated using the digital twin. The image data can recover the required features based on other features available through the previous inspection. Furthermore, the system can adapt to the unrefined environment, making the proposed system robust and useful for other detection applications. The digital twin makes a recommended decision based on an expert system database during the real-time inspection. © 2021, Offshore Technology Conference. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Subsea field development planning can be a complicated undertaking requiring the coordination and collaboration of multiple engineering and commercial disciplines with competing objectives. Thus, finding the optimal development solution can be challenging. To combat this, a data-centric omnichannel digital platform for configuring subsea field developments has been created. The study workflow orchestrated by the digital platform is detailed along with an overview of the data model, functionality, and deliverables. A case study is presented to demonstrate the value delivered using this digital platform. The digital platform is inherently collaborative as it orchestrates specialist engineering tools and their workflows around the same data for study teams to configure subsea development solutions. The platform is composed of: • A web-based graphical user interface that allows discipline and product engineers to collaboratively configure the system, products, planning and costing for an entire subsea field development scenario, leveraging the same base data i.e., a single source of truth. • A proprietary data model covering system, product (e.g., hardware or equipment), activity planning and costing breakdowns, and; • Microservices that directly attach engineering tools and their workflows to the digital platform to automate product design and analysis. A case study is presented to demonstrate the use of the digital platform on a subsea field development prospect and a qualitative comparison with the conventional way of working is made. The case study illustrates the use of a digital hardware configurator (subsea tree system configuration) and the automated planning workflow for an EPCI (Engineering, Procurement, Construction, and Installation) prospect enabled by the digital platform. The results of the case study demonstrate the platform values and benefits the digital platform delivers. The benefits are underpinned by the automated data transfer, the versioning functionality, software logic, and the common base data used by the microservices. The benefits that have been found when compared with the conventional way of working include: • Faster validation of alternative development scenarios, meaning that more concepts and sensitivities can be investigated in the same length of time; • A reduction in the overall lead time and person hours required to configure and optimize a field development solution; • Design risk reduction, and; • Efficient and consistent transition of data via virtual handovers. This paper demonstrates a new approach for subsea field development planning using a data-centric omnichannel digital platform called Subsea Studio™ FD, which is shown to deliver benefits over the conventional document-centric way of working. The digital platform brings multiple engineering disciplines together to configure optimal development solutions, accounting for competing objectives. It initiates the digital thread through the project lifecycle and will ultimately culminate in a digital twin during project execution, which can be leveraged throughout the life-of-field to optimize operations. © 2021, Offshore Technology Conference.

	abstract = {Total E&P UK Ltd and Merkle have undertaken a proof of concept project to investigate machine learning image analysis applied to image and video data from onshore and offshore sites, in preparation for the deployment of an autonomous asset inspection ground robot in 2019. The aim is to better understand the feasibility of these methods, and to demonstrate the benefits of robotic inspection with regard to improving safety and efficiency, enhancing data capture and reducing operational costs. An object detection model was developed based on high-performance open source algorithms. Transfer learning was applied using a custom-built image library and the result is a model able to detect a range of different types of items in the industrial environment including mobile equipment, process equipment, infrastructure and personnel (with and without PPE). The object detection model is used to feed into object classification anomaly detection models to look at the state of selected pieces of identified equipment, such as whether a valve is open or closed, which can be placed in the context of the expected state of the process equipment by relating it to the digital twin for the asset. An additional object detection model was developed to operate as a gas leak detection system for infrared cameras. The object detection model achieved good results and model performance was driven by the number and quality of images used for the training. An anomaly detection model designed to detect whether ball valves were open or closed delivered good results, with high accuracy and balanced false positive and false negative detection rates. The overall performance of the infrared gas detection model was restricted by the limited volume and variability of the training data, although the false positive detection rate was very low. A significant part of the machine learning was devoted to the development of a consistent labelled image library for oil and gas equipment, infrastructure and gas leaks. Image transformations were tested but boosting the number of images using transforms gave variable results. Additional training and testing data is needed to ensure that the models are as robust as possible, especially for the gas leak detection model. Once the models are productionised and in use, additional data can be used to periodically retrain the models for improved performance. In addition to the machine learning algorithms, a fundamental aspect of the project is the development of the overall technical architecture, supporting the data science. This includes enabling the transfer of data from inspection robots or other connected camera devices into a data store in a cloud computing environment and returning the results to dashboard systems with different levels of detail depending on user requirements.

The first tier consists of using a high-resolution finite element model of the asset, delivered by Akselos unique RB-FEA technology. The subsequent tiers consist in using data from a few strategically placed accelerometers, as well as wave radar recordings, in order to calibrate the model and estimate the real loading on the asset. This concept delivers a true digital twin of the asset and offers a compelling and cost-effective method for offshore assets that are facing life time extension beyond what current methodologies can provide.

	abstract = {On conventional vertical trees (VXTs) with a tubing hanger (TH) in the wellhead (WH), orientation of the VXT to the TH system is a complicated and expensive process. Leveraging patented technology, the tree to hanger orientation ring (THOR) and tooling were implemented to save CAPEX and OPEX while eliminating risks associated with conventional orientation solutions. An open-water tool installs an external alignment feature onto the wellhead, which is oriented with the tubing hanger already installed in the wellhead. The VXT then orients onto the wellhead with the help of this external alignment feature, resulting in correct orientation with the tubing hanger. This paper discusses the novel technology and its successful development and installation for a subsea project, which revolutionizes the VXT portfolio. Rapid development of THOR technology was required along with expedient project execution. Utilizing digital-twin design techniques such as finite element analysis and operator simulations, the operating life of THOR tooling was investigated in parallel with project engineering. The novel nature of the THOR required unconventional testing, which was performed in-house. Project execution plan was implemented for engineering and manufacturing to successfully build the production equipment on schedule. Comprehensive system integration testing was completed upon the first attempt. The system was deployed to staging facilities before being delivered offshore to the customer and installed subsea in stages during April 2020. Involvement of the operators and installation contractors during the development stage made THOR's first deployment attempt a major success with zero recorded nonproductive time, even during COVID-19. THOR technology reduces the number of components as well as the weight and size of the equipment. The novel THOR equipment can be run by a light intervention vessel rather than conventional equipment, which requires mobile offshore drilling units. The time spent to deploy the VXT system is also reduced, minimizing indirect supply-chain and field-service-related carbon emissions.

	abstract = {This paper presents a concept of a mooring digital twin frameworkand a standardized inspection datatemplate to enable digital twin. The mooring digital twin framework supports real-time and/or on-demand decision making in mooring integrity management, which minimizes the failure risk while reducing operation and maintenance cost by efficient inspection, monitoring, repair, and strengthening. An industry survey conducted through the DeepStar project 18403 identified a standard template for recording inspection data as a high priority item to enable application of the digital twins for integrity management. Further, mooring chain was selected as a critical mooring component for which a standard inspection template was needed. The characteristics of damage/performance prediction with the proposed mooring digital twin framework are (i) to utilize surrogates and/or reduced-order models trained by high-fidelity physics simulation models, (ii) to combine all available lifecycle data about the mooring system, (iii) to evaluate current and future asset conditions in a systematic way based on the concept of uncertainty quantification (UQ). The general and mooring-specific digital twin development workflows are described with the identified essential data, physics models, and several UQ methodologies such as surrogate modeling, local and global sensitivity analyses, Bayesian prediction etc. Also, the proposed digital twin system architecture is summarized to illustrate the dataflow in digital twin development andutilization. The prototype of mooring digital twin dashboard, web-based risk visualization and advisory system, is developed to demonstrate the capability to visualize the system health diagnosis and prognosis and suggest possible measures/solutions for the high-risk components as a digital twin's insight. © 2021, Offshore Technology Conference.

	abstract = {With the move towards IIoT and the Digital Age, companies in the process industry are looking to digitalizeprocesses. One critical element in this development is the increased adoption of the Digital Twin (DT),which is being deployed in all phases of a product, plant, or process lifecycle from design to operationsto maintenance. A DT is a virtual representation of a physical product or process used to understand and predictthe physical counterpart's performance characteristics. They are used throughout the product lifecycle tosimulate, predict, and optimize the product and production system before investing in physical prototypes. The concept is not new. For more than 30 years, product and process engineering teams have used 3Drenderings and process simulation to validate manufacturability. What is new, however, is that several factorshave now converged to bring the concept of the DT to the forefront as a disruptive trend in the processindustry. This will be demonstrated using relevant use cases featuring organizations that have seen increasesin efficiency improvements after employing digitalization and the DT By incorporating simulation, data analytics, and machine learning, the DT is able to demonstrate impactsof usage and training scenarios in a virtual setting. This enables identification of any potential issues in thedesign phase as opposed to the commissioning phase as is very common today. Process and sensor data fromphysical objects are collected and analyzed to determine real-time performance and operating changes overtime. Feeding this data back into the product lifecycle, the DT is continuously updated to reflect changesto the physical counterpart. This creates a closed-loop of virtual feedback that makes products, production,and performance optimization possible at minimal cost. © 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {Risk Assessments are used to assess the impact of alternativedesigns, changes during operations, and compliance of offshore installations against tolerabilitycriteria. Typically, asset information is used to develop a mathematical model; this can beupdated to reflect changes during the facility's lifecycle. This paper examines how the use ofcloud-based technology to develop a Digital Twin improves efficiency. Allowing projectstakeholders full access to the QRA model also enables greater understanding of hazards. Digital technology pervades all areas of business and societyand offers great advantages to safety engineering relative to traditional approaches. This paperdemonstrates how cloud basedtools canturn the traditional static QRA process into a living QRA which can be updated throughout aninstallation's lifecycle by creating a digital twin. This type of living QRA allows projectstakeholders to change key parameters and assess the effect of these changes on risk levels. Inaddition, the results can be interrogated down to fundamental levels using a Microsoft Power BIdashboard. The output of QRAs are usually static reports providing anoverview of the detailed work undertaken and a high-level summary of the results which arecompared with tolerability criteria or to demonstrate ALARP. This paper demonstrates howcustomised internet browser tools utilising 2D and 3D graphics may be built on top of the QRA toextract more detail than previously possible and communicate risks in a flexible and interactiveway. It also shows how consistent data management can form a basis for innovating beyond thetraditional approach. This allows a wider range of stakeholders to determine risk drivers, isolatesingle accident scenarios and filter results to a greater depth than is possible through a paperreport and allow a greater understanding of their hazards. Digitalisation is an increasingly ‘hot topic’ in the process industry. Making use of new technologies to provide greater insights can aid in better and more timelyhazard management whilst reducing costs to stakeholders.

	abstract = {Upstream production optimization is concerned with optimizing the entire hydrocarbon value chain from reservoir to sales. In this quest, managing the process facilities to maximize productivity is a critical part. Traditionally, operating companies have addressed it by running offline scenarios to develop a playbook or build physics-based dynamic simulation models. However, a typical offshore facility undergoes significant changes to its operations during its life cycle, which makes the model management tedious and expensive. Few attempts have been made to build data-driven digital twins (machine learning) but they often lack the ability to provide explainable models and lack physical insights. In this work, we propose to use a fast, hybrid, self-learning dynamic process modeling method from routine plant measurements that can be used for real-time forecasts, scenario modeling, process optimization and control. A reduced order modeling method based on input-output dynamic mode decomposition (ioDMD) has been adapted to develop a dynamic process model based on historical data collected from plant sensors. First, we benchmarked the proposed approach with a dynamic simulation model (commercial simulator) using a designed input sequence for training. The ioDMD model simplifies the physical mechanisms to a low dimensional form. Next, we applied the method to an actual offshore deepwater facility based on plant measurements. In both cases, the ioDMD method provided very good predictions without any human intervention. Unlike black-box data-driven methods, the ioDMD method uses an interpretable approach that can be used to explain causal relationships. Observability and controllability of the proposed model can also be easily understood. The proposed ioDMD method provides a unique and sustainable way to combine advanced analytics and physics to develop an explainable dynamic model for the process facility that can be effectively used to assist operations in optimizing performance. The lightweight model lends itself naturally to fast computation that are required for optimization and process control (including IoT edge devices). © Copyright 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers},

	abstract = {The use of numeric simulation tools has been a traditional approach for determining the behavior of equipment and complex engineering operations. These same techniques have been used in the oil & gas industry over the years to help improve efficiency and reduce cost, allowing the exploration of areas that were previously economically unfeasible. Currently, with the increasing development of sensors and communication technologies, real-time numerical simulation is becoming a key tool for a better understanding of drilling dynamics, allowing the prediction of critical events and making operations more efficient and secure. The goal of this work is to present a computational tool that applies the concept of digital-twin to oil drilling systems by proposing the use of physical models to simulate, in real-time, phenomena such as well hydraulics, torque and drag, cuttings concentrations and bed formation. Data collected in real-time from the rig is used as input to the physical models, whose outputs can flow into other models, allowing a multi-physics analysis. The data collected from the sensors and the results provided by the digital-twin tool are stored in a time series database, which is used for the continuous evaluation of errors and efficiency improvement, implementing a learning feedback into the physical model calculations of drilling operations. Enhancements on the accuracy of model calculations are shown, leveraging the aforementioned architecture to monitor well operations, such as hydraulic, torque and drag and cuttings transport, and by the validation of the results by subject matter experts. This work presents how the proposed approach incrementally improves closing equations coefficients with learning feedback, i.e. having historical data from sensors and calculated data continuously being stored into the system, using big data technologies for handling the large volume data. © 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {All operators of offshore facilities aim to provide a safe workplace for their staff. However, in the case of process safety hazards, there will always be some residual potential for high consequence accidents. Making these risks ‘visible’ in both design and operations is an important part of risk management. The industry has developed many techniques for driving process safety hazards to the forefront. Many are qualitative or semi-quantitative and have considerable power in the hands of those with the correct experience. Fully quantitative risk analysis (QRA) is also used but, in the past, has mostly been the domain of technical safety experts and buried in large documents with immense amounts of detail. This inhibits the use of these assessments in design and operational decision processes, as key data may not be available in a timely manner. The terms ‘digitalization’ and ‘digital twin’ are used frequently without any clear explanation of what they mean. In the case of QRA, the data has been digital for decades, there is nothing new in the use of digital computers to arrive at the answers. What is new is the way the development of cloud-based information systems has transformed the delivery and use of data by organizations. A detailed QRA contains risk data that is tagged by both physical location and process system and considers many of the barriers that are used to control and mitigate process risks. This paper explores how cloud-based systems can revolutionize how risk data can be delivered interactively in text, 2D and 3D formats, reflect changes in operating conditions and reach a wider audience. Sensitivities can be quickly rerun for use in decision-making required by the stakeholders. Having this information readily available also opens a path towards integration with asset digital twins, providing a wider information and knowledge source for any asset. © 2020 AIChE Virtual Spring Meeting and 16th Global Congress on Process Safety.

	abstract = {The production riser is a critical element connecting subsea equipment on the seafloor (e.g., subsea production tree, pipeline) to the floating production facility. Looking back on all the installed risers worldwide in the last 3 decades, the steel catenary risers tend to be designed conservatively to accommodate the requirements in applicable codes and standards. There are several riser types adopted for offshore oil and gas production, which includes steel catenary risers (SCRs), top tensioned risers, flexible risers and hybrid riser systems. However, the SCRs, with a simple configuration and low fabrication and installation cost, is the most installed riser configuration for deepwater oil and gas production worldwide in the last 3 decades. SCRs have been facing more challenging environment (e.g., large OD gas export SCRs, and HPHT applications SCRs) and requests for longer service life (e.g., 30 years’ design life). Regulatory bodies (e.g., BSEE in GoM) prefer riser operations to be managed through an integrity management program, demonstrating that a continuous feedback of conditions of risers throughout their service life are in place with their field data maintained in a robust framework, especially for riser life extension applications. This paper investigates the integrity management program for Lingshui 17-2 SCRs that are designed for 30 years of continuous service life in South China Sea. The Lingshui 17-2 riser integrity management (RIM) program starts with reviewing the basis of design, global strength and fatigue performance, and installation analysis results. With the understanding of the global performance, a reliable and robust measurement system for monitoring key SCR performance parameters is proposed; these include vessel motion measurement in six degree of freedom, measurement of SCR top hang-off angles and tension, and full water column current measurement using ADCP. Sampling production fluid as well as documenting fluid data for indicative internal corrosion measurement are also planned. An initial maintenance plan with ROV inspection is established based on the understanding of the design data. A further plan to convert the collected measurement data into riser digital twin analysis input is outlined in this paper. The riser digital twin is part of the existing ABS integrated hull structure-mooring-riser digital twin service. The periodical output of the riser digital twin analysis model helps updating the regular maintenance program that is defined and executed starting from the commissioning/ producing first gas to the decommissioning. © 2020 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).},

The modern techniques of soft computing including artificial intelligence and genetic algorithm-based optimization can add value to this operation. In this work, five key controllable design variables of an oil and gas separation plant are optimized considering two performance indicators (oil flow productivity and gas compression power). The physical model of the plant is simulated using ASPEN HYSYS, and a digital twin model is generated using an artificial neural network. It is followed by a multiobjective optimization using non-dominating sorting genetic algorithm II to obtain the Pareto front. The results have indicated that operational optimization can enhance oil production by up to ∼6.2% and decrease the compression work by ∼3.2%. It is concluded that the proposed operation of the plant is energy-efficient and can increase productivity.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The industry remains focused on achieving efficiency gains through accessing and processing production,asset and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) data, and applying machine learning (ML) principles toarrive at improved outcomes. As a service provider, we are experiencing an increased activity level relatedto hybrid analytics which involves embedding high-fidelity physics-based models together with ML modelsto improve outcomes. Critically, rather than addressing one piece of equipment, or a subset of a facility,companies focus on economies of scale, and seek asset-wide understanding of implications to equipmentcondition when changing operating parameters. Deployment of a Dynamic Digital Twin provides production and maintenance engineers with a 'singlesource of truth' for information (i.e. P&ID, PFD, OEM information, maintenance history, etc.) integratedwith high-fidelity physics-based models for subsea and topsides processes. Field sensors measuringhydrocarbon quantity, quality and other physical properties are integrated to provide real-time and historicdata. Physics-based dynamic process models are first calibrated to match the field sensor data and then usedto generate synthetic data for training ML models. A high-fidelity model generates virtual measurementswhere field sensors are not available. Access to such high-quality virtual measurements presents a paradigmshift for upstream analytics, as ML algorithms now have access to larger datasets for training. This improvesquality, allowing for proactive planning and improved uptime leading to increased facility uptime bypredicting equipment failure and enabling condition-based maintenance (CBM). In our work with major oil and gas operators, we have observed that maintenance engineers until nowhave struggled, because enough field sensors are not always available to support the ML algorithms, leadingto less specific assumptions and lower quality results. By taking advantage of a Dynamic Digital Twin-containing the asset structure, visualization and models-hybrid analytics were applied to continuouslyimprove predictions, thereby increasing facility uptime. In this paper, we present a few case studies of applying hybrid analytics with some oil and gas operatorsto enable virtual flow metering, prediction of unplanned equipment shutdown and prediction of optimumoperating parameters for increased facility uptime. Examples presented demonstrate the integration ML algorithms such as Autoencoder (AE), Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural networks andReinforcement Learning. © 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {Offshore structures monitoring meets crucial economic and environmental issues. Simulations are performed to estimate the behavior of offshore structures. However, simulations are based on assumptions on operating conditions, which are not always sufficient to take into account all the complexity of the real time-dependent environment and structural properties. Efficient monitoring and maintenance operations relies on data gathered from sensors, which provides real conditions and behavior of the structure. Simulations may be too expensive and time-consuming to estimate the updated lifespan from large dataset of measurements. To address these issues, Phimeca and Principia had developed a methodology based on measurements to obtain rapid and updated prediction of the structure's lifespan. This methodology was successfully applied to the monitoring of a riser of a FPSO (Floating Production Storage and Offloading). First, the episodes of motion measured on the FPSO for 2 years were used to simulate the damage of the riser. The time series describing these episodes were transformed, by applying a combination of machine learning methods, so that the problem dimension was drastically reduced: with initially thousands of variables, only two explain the simulated damage efficiently. Finally, an emulator (metamodel), has been trained and validated to be embedded into the FPSO and to estimate the lifespan of the structure during its life. The dimension reduction makes the emulator numerically light enough to be embedded into the structure and to be compatible with constrained systems. This methodology enables offshore structure owners and operators to obtain a fast updated lifespan prediction from an embedded light software, without any delay due to complex simulations. Thus, decision can be made faster to ensure structural and environmental safety in case of a dangerous event. © ESREL 2021. Published by Research Publishing, Singapore.},

	abstract = {The CarbonNet Project is operated by the state of Victoria, and jointly funded and managed by State and Federal governments. The Pelican storage site is situated in the shallow marine environment, between 1 to 15 km offshore from the iconic Ninety Mile Beach in Victoria, Australia. A storage site capacity for greenhouse gas (GHG) of at least 125 million tonnes has now been confirmed using new state-of-the-art high-resolution 3D seismic data, as described in this paper, covering the P90 probabilistic 3D volume of future plume travel in a wide range of scenarios and sensitivities. A new appraisal well (Gular-1) has also recently been completed, confirming pressure isolation across the main seal interval and suitable sandstone lithologies for storage, with excellent multi-layered reservoirs (up to 10 darcy permeability, over 150m net). The storage site has undergone careful and diligent appraisal to demonstrate its suitability for storage of CO2 at commercial scale. Initial site screening and characterization relied upon the open-file petroleum database that is available to CarbonNet in this basin - consisting of over 1,500 exploration and development wells and extensive 3D seismic data offshore, supplemented by extensive onshore 2D seismic data. In addition, over 20,000 onshore boreholes targeting brown coal resources allow an excellent onshore-offshore stratigraphic correlation and detailed interpretation of depositional environments and facies geometries. A significant data gap existed in nearshore waters, inside the 3 nautical mile limit of state jurisdiction (~5.5 km). In this zone only older 1980's vintage wide spaced (200m) reconnaissance 3D existed with poor spatial resolution and relatively low frequencies giving limited temporal resolution. Importantly, this older survey was substantially damaged by 9-track tape oxide loss during storage. A new survey (known as the Pelican 3D survey, and designated GCN18A in formal records) was designed with high spatial resolution (12.5 m bin size, with potential to refine to the native 6.25 x 12.5m spacing), and high temporal resolution with extended frequency processing. This is the first offshore 3D seismic survey in Australia designed for GHG storage purposes. The design area of the survey covers the entire area of potential future plume travel, assessed to a probability level of at least P90. Water depth ranged from 37.5 m in the outboard part of the survey, to a minimum of 15m, defining the inboard edge of the survey at approximately 1.15 km from shore for the vessel track, with four streamers deployed on each side of the vessel out to 150m from the centerline. Twin (flip-flop) seismic sources were deployed at 12.5 m separation from the centerline to deliver maximum lateral offset reflection CMP's 81.25 m inboard of the vessel track. Some imaging capacity exists beyond the formal maximum offset CMP due to 3D migration effects, but the effective limit of imaging is around 1 km from the shoreline. Infill of this shallow water area would require transition zone acquisition technology or co-deployment of onshore receiver arrays. Neither of these additional imaging options was selected at this stage of the project, since injected/stored CO2 will not reach this region for many decades to centuries, if ever, and will never reach the shoreline (the permit boundary) at any future time, as proven by good structural control of the plume and definitive mapping from 2D seismic data and a key onshore well. The processing route for the data adopted a modern broadband processing flow for pre-stack depth migration with multiple tomographic velocity iterations including velocity anisotropy. The 3D depth data was tied to a pre-existing well within the data volume. The corresponding time-processed data was merged (wavelet-matched) with existing legacy 3D data in seismic two-way-time (TWT) to provide a seamless 3D volume that allowed confident seismic ties to 19 local exploration wells and 10 development wells in the nearby Barracouta giant gas field. Interpretation of the new data has demonstrated an unprecedented resolution of sedimentary systems in the target Traralgon Formation (the upper part of the Latrobe group, in the nearshore area). Both reservoir and seal systems have been imaged in detail to fourth-order in sequence stratigraphic terms (cyclical units resolved to 7.5m thickness and spanning 0.25 Ma of geologic time). This detailed understanding of depositional systems allows prediction of seal and reservoir properties between wells and the predictions have been tested and largely proven by the recent Gular-1 appraisal well (data well). The GCN18A Pelican 3D survey is designed as the initial baseline for later timelapse surveys. These may be 3D surveys with similar geometry and acquisition technology, or may be simplified 2D profiles across key structural sections, such as the axis of the Pelican anticline below which CO2 migration will occur. Additional seismic imaging options include permanent DAS fibres in injection and monitor wellbores, and as seabed laid cables including co-location with the planned CO2 delivery pipeline to the offshore injection location. Final monitoring design will incorporate findings of the CO2CRC Stage 3 project and other international advances in permanent monitoring receivers and sources. © 2021 15th Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies Conference 2021, GHGT 2021.

	abstract = {Offshore full-processing platforms are permanently manned due to the large number of operational and maintenance tasks. Having these platforms unmanned and remotely operated would improve the field economy, reduce the personnel risk and minimize the environmental footprint. The use of subsea mindset and technology in the platform design can enable such a shift in the manning and operations regime. Unmanned platforms have been in operation for decades in the form of simple platforms without complex process functions. The frequency of visits has however, turned out to be quite high. Further, maintaining facilities as unmanned has proved challenging when processing functions are added. To enable full-processing platforms to operate as unmanned installations, a new approach to design can be adopted. This new approach is characterized by use of design principles for complex subsea processing facilities and benefitting from the digital revolution. A main difference when comparing subsea and topside processing facilities is the significant number of utilities, support and safety functions on a platform. For the new platform concept proposed, several of these functions are simplified or eliminated, which reduces complexity, the need for maintenance and cost. The platform concept is among others proposed without accommodation and helideck. Access by personnel and evacuation is via bridge to Service Operation Vessel. By examining the Mean Time Between Failure for topside vs subsea equipment, it is evident that the subsea equipment has higher availability and requires less maintenance. For the topside equipment which as of today is maintenance intensive, e.g. compressors and pumps, the concept includes using subsea derived equipment. Seal-less subsea derived compressors are already proven for topside application. The maintenance need is determined based on surveillance by sensors and predictive analytics, i.e. predictive maintenance. On a staffed facility there are cranes and trolleys for material handling and personnel are carrying out in-situ inspection and repairs, representing a significant number of offshore man-hours. For Subsea installations, the principle is plug & play replacement by use of intervention vessels. The layout of the new platform concept is arranged in a subsea derived manner adopting the replacement principle by use of vessels. Also, the platform is proposed with robotics tailored for intervention of minor items. New technologies as drones and crawlers are developing rapidly and are used for inspection tasks replacing personnel, in addition to sensors and cameras and in combination with a digital twin. These technologies are comparable to using ROV for inspection of subsea equipment. This paper will present the conceptual idea for the subsea derived full-processing unmanned platform in more detail, and discuss benefits compared to a conventional staffed full-processing platform. © 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.},

These measurements, however, are required to be reportedat the API standard temperature (120/150 oF). As the rheological properties of the drilling fluids varysignificantly with temperature, it is essential to calibrate sensor measurements at the ambient temperature tothe API standard. Previous attempts in the literature to build data-driven frameworks for predicting drillingfluids behavior demonstrate limited success due to restrained data access, neglect of the physics, and/or useof improper algorithms, such as neural networks which are shown to perform poorly despite their popularity.In this work, we develop a digital twin to calibrate the rigsite rheology measurements for obtaining theAPI standard properties by exploring the use of a set of promising machine learning algorithms. A datasetcomposed of various drilling fluids composition with rheological measurements at both rigsite and APIconditions is collected. Our results demonstrate that the ensemble algorithm outperform other commonlyused methods, such as regularized regression, polynomial regression, and neural networks.

Due to the large number of available components and challenging operational profiles, there is no longer a single best solution, especially in specialized shipbuilding. On top of that even minor changes in the propulsion system can have a substantial impact on plant performance and vessel behavior. Thus, the early design stage is crucial. The design procedure usually incorporates the selection and dimensioning of available components and concepts. Once this has been done, the dynamic behavior can be analyzed using the developed system simulation environment. With the knowledge gained the needed alterations in the concept can be identified and implemented in the subsequent design iteration circle. Based on the example of an offshore anchor handling vessel, the integration potential of a hybrid propulsion system is examined and evaluated according to the aforementioned procedure.

	abstract = {Autonomous tugs may play an important role in future ports, due to the shortage of qualified mariners. A digital twin (mathematical model incorporating a vessel's hydrodynamic behavior and response, suitable for real-time control) would be needed for autonomous operations. Yet, partly because tugs are generally high-powered and very maneuverable compared to conventional vessels, there is little published data on the hydrodynamic performance of such vessels. As a first step in the development of the tug's digital twin, the present work studies the maneuvering and seakeeping performance of a generic tug at model scale. Numerical simulations are performed for an approximately 1:10 scale model for standard resistance, static and dynamic captive and seakeeping cases.

	abstract = {Engineering simulation has become the pivotal tool for research and development in industries including offshore oil & gas, aerospace, automotive, mobile/off-highway, health care, and others. This case study will explore the financial and time-based savings achieved through detailed simulations and a system-based design approach in two hydraulic valve development projects. The applications in this scope include subsea blowout preventer and off-highway mobile equipment controls. Tools like 1D system simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis are widely accepted; verification and validation (V&V) of these models is imperative in building confidence in simulation. Some V&V reference standards have been developed by groups like ASME and API, but they do not encompass all aspects of simulation regularly utilized by the modern analyst. This places the onus for the creation of V&V guidelines onto individual analysts and their respective employers. Lack of detail in these guidelines can lead to flawed interpretations of results and a corresponding loss of trust in analytical methods. Interdisciplinary organizations can provide forums to help bridge these gaps and create more comprehensive V&V guidelines. Through a study of the development cycles of a subsea valve and an off-highway mobile valve, examples will be outlined which illustrate the benefit of extensive upfront simulation validated by physical testing. Simulation work serves as a cost avoidance measure against many cycles of building and testing prototypes beyond what is truly required in the early stages of design. Accurate simulation is a key component of successful product development, but another often neglected factor is the collaboration between subject matter experts from the component suppliers and the OEM or system integrator. High performance teams comprised of seasoned designers, analysts, and market experts can collaborate to create devices that excel when integrated into a final product. Component designers may wish to isolate the design problem to the component in question, but critical engineering detail will be missed by avoiding a system approach. Expanding the scope of the design analysis to include as much of the application as possible as well as utilizing V&V techniques (beyond minimum industry standards) is key to ensuring that laboratory test data is representative of how a product will perform in its intended application. As the industry continues to evolve, powerful digital twins of systems like blowout preventers can be used for OEM validation of new technology proposed for these systems. However, the fidelity of these digital twins is contingent upon the inputs from thoroughly validated analytical models of the components that comprise the system. By collaborating across the customer-supplier value chain and investing heavily in simulation, offshore manufacturers can strategically position themselves to win in times when both customer expectations and the costs of failure are at an all-time high. © 2021, Offshore Technology Conference.

	abstract = {Presently, drilling riser joints are inspected every five years. This is usually accomplished by rotating 20% onshore every year to be dis-assembled and inspected. This requires extensive boat trips from a mobile operating drilling unit (MODU) to onshore and trucking of the riser to the inspection facility. Typically, 20 riser joints from each riser system are transported on a boat and one riser per truck to an inspection facility each year, making the logistics of performing a drilling inspection complex and costly. A laser-based measurement for inspection together with monitoring of riser systems has been implemented with a new standard process for collecting critical riser data that is ABS approved. The aim is to mitigate the costs and time associated with essential MODU drilling riser inspections, by empowering operators to reliably determine the condition of drilling riser joints, consistently predict when vital components will require service and accurately assess remaining component life. The approach utilizes a life cycle condition based monitoring, maintenance and inspection system that can be deployed on a MODU, enabling resources to be deployed only when necessary, instead of on a calendar interval. The solution consists of: Performing a baseline inspection on the riser joints to assess their present state, Collecting the environmental and operating data when the rig is on site drilling, Feeding the environmental and operating data into a digital twin. The tuned digital twin can be used to predict future damage. The approach removes uncertainties surrounding damage of riser joints and will allow the owner to determine whether riser should be redeployed or replaced. This is the only process that is ABS approved for condition based monitoring of drilling riser systems. The system is compatible with all present owners’ maintenance programs and ensures that maintenance requirements are supported with robust engineering.

	abstract = {The recent decline in crude oil prices due to global competition and COVID-19-related demand issues has highlighted the need for the efficient operation of an oil and gas plant. One such avenue is accurate predictions about the remaining useful life (RUL) of components used in oil and gas plants. A tribosystem is comprised of the surfaces in relative motion and the lubricant between them. Lubricant oils play a significant role in keeping any tribosystem such as bearings and gears working smoothly over the lifetime of the oil and gas plant. The lubricant oil needs replenishment from time to time to avoid component breakdown due to the increased presence of wear debris and friction between the sliding surfaces of bearings and gears. Traditionally, this oil change is carried out at pre-determined times. This paper explored the possibilities of employing machine learning to predict early failure behavior in sensor-instrumented tribosystems. Specifically, deep learning and tribological data obtained from sensors deployed on the components can provide more accurate predictions about the RUL of the tribosystem. This automated maintenance can improve the overall efficiency of the component. The present study aimed to develop a deep learning-based digital twin for accurately predicting the RUL of a tribosystem comprised of a ball bearing-like test apparatus, a four-ball tester, and lubricant oil. A commercial lubricant used in the offshore oil and gas components was tested for its extreme pressure performance, and its welding load was measured using a four-ball tester. Three accelerated deterioration tests was carried out on the four-ball tester at a load below the welding load. Based on the wear scar measurements obtained from the experimental tests, the RUL data were used to train a multivariate convolutional neural network (CNN). The training accuracy of the model was above 99%, and the testing accuracy was above 95%. This work involved the model-free learning prediction of the remaining useful lifetime of ball bearing-type contacts as a function of key sensor input data (i.e., load, friction, temperature). This model can be deployed for in-field tribological machine elements to trigger automated maintenance without explicitly measuring the wear phenomenon. © 2021 by the authors.

FPSO projects critical path is the hull construction and changes are being made to shorten the duration of this process. For this to be feasible, hull project must be standardized to fit various topside configurations and any changes made must be absorbed as quickly as possible. This requires the use of innovative solutions and digital technologies to reduce design time. The core of these solutions is the modelling of the hull digital twin during the basic design phase with a high level of structural definitions that only happen during detailed engineering phase. This paper presents some initiatives that results in a more consistent design and on a desktop-based virtual reality model that can be used to accelerate fabrication during construction and assembly phases.

	abstract = {A digital twin is a virtual representation of a living or non-living physical entity. It can serve as a real time digital counterpart of a physical object or process. Using a digital twin, not only can different failure scenarios be studied, but corrective action plans can be evaluated prior to implementation. This presentation will concentrate on the finite element analysis (FEA) method, which is one of the earliest forms of representing a physical entity using a numerical model. The finite element analysis is an approximate numerical technique. Early finite element codes were developed by NASA to support the space program, providing stress, dynamic response, and heat transfer analysis of complex systems. This paper presents the evolution of using finite element simulations for root-cause failure analysis of industrial mechanical equipment, and to assist in the development of corrective action plans. Special emphasis is placed on correlation of the digital twin to test data. Case studies spanning nearly four decades will be used to illustrate the progression of the technique. These cases involve: 1) Fatigue failure of large autogenous grinding mills at an iron ore mine and processing plant performed in the early days of finite element analysis, 2) Extremely reduced mean-time-between-failure (MTBF) rates of belts for cooling tower fans on an offshore production platform performed recently using modern FEA capabilities, and 3) Catastrophic failure of a fan rotor at a food processing plant that required FEA to estimate the effects of centrifugal stress stiffening.  © 2021 Vibration Institute All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {E&P companies are increasingly challenged with cost-effective development or upgrade of remote fields, ensuring crew safety and regulatory requirements for reducing environmental impact. Remote operations and unmanned platforms have significantly lower CO2 emissions and lowerCAPEX and OPEX in areas of sparse infrastructure. Complete electrification of safety critical control systems is key to maintain safe production while digitization, automation and condition based maintenance reduce required on-site personnel. An all-electric wellhead- and production tree valve actuator for handling emergency situations has been developed under a Joint Industry Project by Equinor, Baker Hughes and TECHNI. PACT utilize a completely new, patent pending failsafe mechanism that is inherently safe without requirement for redundancy. PACT contains an embedded controller and sensors with extremely low power consumption rendering it well suited for solar/alternate power sources. A new super-capacitor is under development in partnership with the University of Southeast Norway, that in combination with the fastest failsafe mechanism ever ensure safety in all modes of operation, even with all lines down or consumed by flames. Electric actuators offer significant CAPEX savings over hydraulic actuators by eliminating costly hydraulic control systems and hydraulic lines as well as saving space and weight. Overall system cost is significantly lower than hydraulic systems (Equinor estimates at around USD 2million per well for an unmanned platform) while also reducing emissions and environmental impact. Globally, there are approximately 7000 offshore platforms of which 1600 are unmanned (200 in the Middle East). The existing population of unmanned platforms is undergoing continual upgrades and there are significant cost savings by using the PACT as a drop-in replacement for existing hydraulic systems, while enabling fully digitized, remote control and autonomous operations. Low power consumption, weight and a small footprint renders it equally suited for land wells, including retrofit upgrades without reinforcing infrastructure. PACT is designed to be an integral part of automated and remote-control systems and the modular technology is also being adopted for subsea trees, as well as other mission critical pressure control applications. Given the significant benefits in simplifying operations and reducing cost while improving HSSE, leading E&P companies including Equinor, Total, Aker BP and others have chosen electric operations as future technology platform for both topside and subsea operations. Embedded force-, pressure-, temperature- and vibration sensors enable data-driven, fact- and condition based maintenance. Aggregating real-time and historical data, component- and system models ensures fully remote/autonomous operation with a digital twin. The novel failsafe-mechanism fronts the most reliable action of all times while the patent pending solution ensures closing times down to 1 second. In 2020 the consortium was awarded USD 950 000 in government support funding and in May 2021 PACT won OTC Spotlight on New Technology award.

	abstract = {Simulation is increasingly used as an engineering tool in the maritime industry. Currently, there is a particular focus on digital twins, where a supplier of equipment should also supply a simulation model of the equipment. Today, the person configuring the simulator must manually connect all required signals between these models, interpreting the meaning of each signal name to determine which signal can be connected together (e.g., connecting "pressure out" to "pressure in", while ensuring that their units match). This is a tedious and error-prone process. In this paper, we present a method for automatically connecting variables of different models while complying with the FMI standard in co-simulations. This also includes a method for unit conversions. The methods for both automatic connections and unit conversions are based on ontologies. The key idea is to build an ontology, based on existing ontologies, which enables structuring model input and output variables into groups and hierarchies, and assign them a defined type. This enables reasoning about connections between models, and simplifies the model connections. The focus in this paper is to present the ontology, how FMI interface signals can be connected to the ontology, and how this can be used to simplify model connections. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

However, there remains a great deal of confusion surrounding what a digital twin actually is and how it can be harnessed to add value to oil and gas operations. Some use digital twin as a synonym for their 3D plant models, others for their predictive maintenance solutions, or their simulation models. The bottom line is that the digital twin is all of these and more and unless operators look at it holistically, they are likely to miss out on some of the benefits. Digital twins afford companies a number of advantages that would otherwise not be possible, including the ability to run risk analyses, health assessments, and what-if scenarios in real-time; the ability to train personnel in a 3D immersive, risk-free environment; and the capability to detect faults early before control limits are reached. This paper/ presentation will elaborate on how digital twins can be used to enhance efficiency and will address their use in the wider context of the oil and gas industry – with a particular focus on its impact on reducing risk and cost during both the project and operational phases of the asset lifecycle. The objective is to demystify the digital twin, outline the advanced capabilities it enables and illustrate how oil and gas operators can use this concept to improve their competitive advantage.

	abstract = {Considering the low and volatile oil and gas prices, cost reductions are an impending challenge in the oil and gas industry. For example, offshore pipelines constitute approximately 12% of total CAPEX and potentially 30% of the total OPEX of the entire offshore field development cost. Workforce shortages and manual engineering processes have a high cost impact due to the excessive time to optimize pipeline design, construction, and operation for a robust and efficient system. If the design phase takes excessive time, it is difficult to optimize cost for CAPEX and OPEX while managing risks, with the added complexity of price uncertainties in the market due to unforeseen geopolitical instability. The objective of this paper is to present an artificial intelligence and automation driven pipeline engineering computation system for performing pipeline design and integrity engineering that can save substantial engineering time with a better and optimized design that can accommodate to crude price uncertainty. A comprehensive computational framework is utilized for pipeline conceptual/preliminary, FEED and operational integrity analysis. The digital computational framework is equipped with a distributed data intake, a robotics process automation, and a predictive analytics computation system. A self-service 3D digital twin creator is utilized to operate from the front end and receiving intelligence from the analysis. The automated design engineering engine is utilized to perform and create ready reports for conceptual/ preliminary and FEED/Detail design of a subsea pipeline system. A predictive analytics computation system is utilized to perform pipeline operational integrity using in-line-inspection data and life prediction. The computational system was tested for a subsea flowline conceptual, FEED level design (i.e. pipeline thermo-mechanical and on-bottom-roughness FEA analysis) and thermomechanical structural integrity during the operational phase. The design time was substantially lower than the traditional manual pipeline design suggested a saving as much as 80% of the engineering time. The computation engine was also tested to conduct pipeline integrity using machine learning from direct in-line-inspection data. The flexibility and scalability of the computational framework allow incorporation of any organization's existing pipeline data and engineering process. The significant saving in the engineering time should be able to reduce contingency in hedging due to the price uncertainty. The novel computational framework is made available online offers real-time on-demand analytics for instant intelligence for making decisions for both in design and in operational phases. Reusing of all engineering efforts over the life of the pipeline or for other projects is another possibility offered by the cloud-based computational framework. © 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers},

	abstract = {The latest focus on floating offshore developments is to minimize or remove the human presence onboardby utilizing remote operations. This may reduce personnel exposure and potentially overall costs by usingnew technologies. Existing codes or regulations are not tailored to address unmanned (UM) or minimallymanned (MM) floating installations. Such floating facilities are remotely operated from a nearby facilityor a control center located onshore. Offshore facilities remotely operated require real time monitoring,control automation, and maintenance procedures incorporating remote diagnostics and simulations, withminimal human intervention. This concept brings into focus the design of the remote-control center, thecommunication infrastructure, smart functionalities, digital twins and simulation technologies. In orderto achieve the objectives of an UM or MM facility, hull and machinery inspections onboard the facilityare expected to be minimized, and design features adopted for remote inspection using new technologies.Enhancing the fatigue life of the hull structure and reliability of critical machinery are fundamental to thisconcept. This paper proposes guidance to develop and manage an UM or MM facility through lifecycle activities ofdesign, construction, integration, testing, operation, monitoring, inspection and maintenance in comparisonwith conventional facilities. The adopted approach identifies risk related to the concept and proposesmeasures to help develop appropriate design and safety requirements under a lifecycle perspective. Theexisting codes, standards and class society rules contain applicable requirements for floating facilities relatedto design, operations and maintenance. The study is based on the review of existing rules and regulationsincluding associated gap analysis. The study concludes that existing structural rules may be applied as a baserequirement to address structural integrity, inspection and maintenance risk. From machinery perspective,new technologies will need to be implemented to address monitoring, control, inspection and maintenanceissues. The paradigm shift will be in designing the facility to move from a traditional maintenance plan toa Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) requiring human intervention on a minimal need-basis. This paper also addresses the design and safety considerations based on risks, new technologyqualification (TQ) and human factors for continued operations, since the limited or temporary crew will berequired to perform multidisciplinary activities, and habitability design should assist and augment onboardcrew ability. © 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.},

This transferable framework is verified within a practicaldemonstration scenario, based on asset inspection within a confined space, and representing a Beyond VisualLine of Sight (BVLOS) use case. The methodology of the framework is based on computationally efficientanalysis to support run-time, front-end, data analysis and adaptive decision-making. Utilizing the HuskyA200 platform, manufactured by Clearpath, front-end datasets on the mission status and diagnostics ofcritical sub-systems within the Husky platform are used to update run-time system ontologies. The holisticand hierarchical-relational model of the robot integrates the automata of the sensed and some non-sensedcomponents, using prior knowledge, such as risk assessments and offline reliability data, to support run-timeanalysis, such as fault prognosis, detection, isolation and diagnosis. These computationally efficient dataand system analyses then enable faults to be translated into failure modes that can affect decision makingduring the mission. With respect to challenges of a dynamic environment, namely ambient conditions orthe presence of unexpected people, Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) sensing is integratedonto the husky platform. The FMCW supports localization in opaque environments and detection of peoplewithin and out-with of the confined space, as well as enabling integrity analysis of the infrastructure. Theframework presents its results within a symbiotic digital twin of the infrastructure and robotic platform.With fully synchronized communication and data streams, the interactive digital twin provides operationaldecision support and trust for human in the loop operators of varying skill levels. The presentation ofactionable information to the end user is used to support improvements in productivity associated with assetintegrity as well as supporting user trust in safety during a BVLOS mission. © 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.},

Intended to estimate some of these parameters, the present work proposes a method purely based on traditional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) focused for limited drift angles. Albeit not posing as a replacement to conventional estimations, such as from Computer Fluid Dynamics (CFD) - which solve equations in order of millions - and experimental tests - with its time-consuming preparation setups and postanalyses - the method can possibly present itself as a convenient and quicky technique to estimate the hydrodynamics coefficients in real time, as each iteration resorts only into a few dozen of equations. Preliminary results in the simulated environment called pyDyna - a python version of the Numerical Offshore Tank ship maneuvering simulator - indicate this procedure is faster along with an acceptable margin of accuracy, possibly pointing as a feature for future digital twin applications.

	abstract = {Offshore oil and gas operators may have been slow to realize the potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) and digital transformation, but with the market downturn slowly fading into the rearview mirror, the industry is quickly catching up. Still, there is much that companies can learn from the "early adopters" of digitalization. This paper discusses how digital technologies are being applied in other verticals that are further along the maturity curve (i.e., automotive, manufacturing, marine, aerospace) and how they can be leveraged to optimize the lifecycle performance of offshore oil and gas facilities. The paper details the benefits of extending digitalization across the energy enterprise to drive down costs and decouple market volatility from profitability. Case studies will be shared from the aforementioned verticals to illustrate how advanced tools, such as digital twins and enterprise product lifecycle management (PLM) solutions have been successfully applied to reduce product cycle times and improve project execution. All of these are highly applicable to upstream oil and gas, and can serve as powerful tools for shortening time to first oil. Overall, the paper aims to provide a broader context for exploration and production (E&P) companies' digital enterprise strategies. © 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.},

The strength of the digital twin concept is the interconnectivity of data and models. Any model can use any combination of inputs (e.g. operator owned data sets and sensors, third-party databases such as soil composition or weather data, results from other models such as flow assurance, threat modelling or risk modelling). Consequently, the result of one model may become the input of another. This strength is also a weakness, as uncertain (or missing data) will lead to a great source of uncertainty and may lead to wrong results. Worst case scenarios have been used to solve this issue without success. This paper presents a new concept: probabilistic digital twins for pipelines. Probabilistic digital twins do not lose uncertainty as results pass from one model to another, thus providing greater confidence in the final results. This publication reviews the probabilistic digital twin concept and demonstrates how it can be implemented using gas pipeline data from West Pipeline Company, CNPC. Copyright © 2020 ASME},

Moreover, the range of regulations has increased and customer requirements have diversified. As a result, a new paradigm for the manufacturing environment is needed to improve competitiveness. As IT technology develops, we are making efforts to improve product design and production efficiency by combining various technologies such as digital twin, virtual reality and augmented reality. To use these technologies, 3D models of products are important. A product model exists in a 3D CAD system, which is required to utilize the model. The focus of previous research was on shape transformation using neutral formats such as igs and step files. However, this was also incomplete, and would be better visualized in virtual/augmented reality. In this study, we aimed to develop a framework to extract and visualize 3D models that could be used in augmented/virtual reality in real time and we conducted a test to verify the framework’s validity and efficiency. As a result of the test, it is expected that this framework will be a valuable variety field in the lifecycles of a ship, an offshore structure, and an industrial plant. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things has popularized the notion of a digital twin - a virtual representation of a physical system. There are substantial risks associated with designing a development plan for an oilfield and the industry has been making use of reservoir models - digital twins - to improve the decision-making process for many years. With an increase in the availability of computational resources, the industry is moving towards ensemble-based workflows to estimate risk in field development plans. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of an integrated ensemble-based approach to assess uncertainties in the reservoir models and quantify their impact on the decision-making process. An important feature of a digital twin is its ability to use sensor data to update the virtual model, more commonly known as history matching or data assimilation. We demonstrate how production data can be used to identify and constrain the uncertainties in the reservoir model. Production data is incorporated using Bayesian statistics and state-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques to create an ensemble of models that capture the range of uncertainties in the reservoir model. This ensemble of calibrated models with an improved predictive ability provides a realistic assessment of the uncertainty associated with production forecasts. The ensemble-based approach is demonstrated through its application on an offshore oilfield located in the North Sea. The field is highly compartmentalized and has high structural uncertainty following the interpretation and depth conversion. An integrated cross-domain model is set up to incorporate typically ignored structural uncertainty in addition to the uncertainties and their dependencies in the dynamic parameters, including fault transmissibility, pore-volume, fluid contacts, saturation, and relative permeability endpoints, etc. Results from the history matched ensemble of models show a significa nt reduction in uncertainty in these parameters and the predicted production. An advantage of the proposed technique is that the automated, repeatable, and auditable ensemble-based workflow can assimilate the newly acquired measured data into the reservoir model at any time, keeping the model up-to-date and evergreen.

	abstract = {The operation and development of the oil and gas fields requires the solution of issues related to the optimization of generation and consumption of elec-tricity, the use of the most modern energy-efficient technologies, which allow to ensure a continuous power supply of offshore hydraulic structures (OHS). A specific feature of the development of offshore oil fields is the difficulty of ensuring significant ‘flexibility’ of power supply systems for the entire OHS fleet, allowing to quickly meet the needs and changes in the technological scheme of development, construction, methods of field exploitation, while having the capacity and reserves corresponding to the current state. In order to ensure continuous production, Vietsovpetro JV has created a unique, energy-efficient, autonomous power supply system for hydraulic structures-the United Power Grid (UPG). UPG energy efficiency was achieved through the implementation of utilization system for associated gas, treated as fuel for the energy hub turbine generators. The article describes the main elements of UPG, incorporated limiting systems for short-circuit currents and power factor compensation. The introduction of the UPG made it possible to increase the utilization rate of associated gas, reduce op-erating costs, and improve the quality and reliability of electricity supply, while the Digital Twin for UPG allowed significantly reduce the time, optimize oper-ating and capital costs during an upgrade and development of the energy system. The article covers the stages of UPG creation, its current state and describes the generating-consuming balance for electricity at the steady run. The paper presents the actual data on production costs reduction and provides for the system development perspective – power supply of mobile offshore structures, complete implementation of operational dispatching management system and integration of the advanced M&R system for energy equipment based on actual condition, resulting in significant reduction of losses in production costs. © 2020, Neftyanoe Khozyaistvo.

	abstract = {Installing ESPs in a reservoir for the first time is always fraught with the uncertainty of achieving economic run lives and this is further amplified in harsh conditions. To mitigate the financial and production risks,   sufficient production gains are required to overcome potential short ESP run lives. This paper discusses the results of four pilot ESP wells in Algeria and how infant mortality was eliminated in addition to achieving early production   gains. Key to achieving the production gains was candidate selection and well testing to confirm the well productivity and aquifer pressure support. This process also mitigated risk by selecting wells from a reservoir sector with a   historical low incidence of asphaltenes and GORs, which have not spiked substantially above solution GOR. Once the ESPs were installed, the production gains were achieved by correctly managing drawdown through real time surveillance,   which was also used to manage the stress on the ESP and avoid infant mortality. Longer term run lives was achieved by selecting the correct ESP materials and completion architecture for the well conditions. At the time of writing this   paper, none of the four ESPs had failed. The most recent installation had been running for 400 days and the oldest for over 1,300days, which is no small feat when one considers the harsh conditions; a reservoir depth of 10,500 ft TVD   with a bottom hole temperature of 245 deg F and a volatile hydrocarbon (41 deg API) with a high GOR. This is compounded by an aquifer with water densities as high as 1.25 due to high salt content, which causes both corrosion and halite   scale to form on a regular basis, which was treated with fresh water injection. In two of these wells, net oil production was doubled, but more importantly the recovery factor was substantially increased as the higher ESP drawdown   mobilised reserves which would not have been produced with gas lift. Finally, the injection gas saved from converting two wells to ESP was sufficient to complete 4 to 5 new wells with gas lift completions. In terms of technology, the   main innovation was the use of an ESP digital twin to monitor ESP health in real time, which was particularly useful in managing the transients associated with slugging. An equally noteworthy take-away was how a holistic approach, which   integrated reservoir, completions and production engineering provided seamless management from project definition all the way through to execution.

	abstract = {A Digital Twin is a software representation of a facility which can be used to understand, predict, and optimize performance to help to achieve top performance and recover future operational losses. The Digital twin consists of three components: a process model, a set of control algorithms, and knowledge. Usually the time for commissioning a project exceeds the initial estimations, therefore delays in project completion are quite common. This is often because ICSS testing is done on a static system which does not account for how the system will react dynamically to certain scenarios such as start-ups and shutdowns. Issues such as configuration errors, loop behaviors, start-up over-rides, dead-lock inter-trips and sequence logic are difficult to predict and are impossible to anticipate during static testing. Such delays lead to higher costs and therefore reduced revenue. This paper aims to describe the most innovative approach to Project & Operational Certainty, which addresses these issues by using a Digital Twin for commissioning support and training. One successful use of this approach was in the Culzean project, an ultra-high-pressure high temperature (UHP/HT) gas condensate development in the UK sector of the Central North Sea. A high-fidelity process model was built and fitted to the actual plant performance based on equipment data sheets. This was connected to ICSS database and graphics, offering a realistic environment, very close to the one offshore, which had the same look and feel for the operators. Dynamic tests conducted on the Digital Twin predicted issues on the real system, which enabled potential solutions to be tested, leading to a significant decrease in the time spent and cost during commissioning. All the operating procedures were dynamically tested, which enabled us to correct errors, saving time before First Gas. Additionally, all CRO (Control Room Operators) and field technicians were trained and made familiar with the system months in advance, aiming to avoid future unnecessary trips during First Gas. Finally, all the control loops were fine tuned in the Digital Twin and parameters were passed to off shore, to be used as first starting point. It is expected that these parameters will be very close to fine operational points, as the model used is high fidelity model and very close to real system offshore.

The current effects are treated as additional ship over water speed, while the wave effects are considered by superimposing the second-order mean wave drift loads to the calm water hull hydrodynamics. The wave drift loads are solved using the potential flow solver WASIM, which is based on Rankine panel method.

	abstract = {In the recent decade, maritime and energy industries have realized the potential of using operational data in combination with a virtual replication of the real physical asset, termed the digital twin. The digital twin then serves as a platform for data management, asset monitoring, and inspection and maintenance management, featuring an improved basis for cost effective operations and future decision making in terms of e.g. life extension. The present paper deals with application of the digital twin concept in marine operations where it is essential to handle the inherent uncertainties of vessel performance by applying a model that can adapt to the real operating conditions. In this paper a case study is presented for identifying the most sensitive parameters in the vessel hydrodynamic model w.r.t. the vessel motion RAOs. The study also shows that the parametric sensitivity depends on the interesting vessel response parameter, wave direction and loading condition. A digital twin adaptive to various operational conditions may require parametric tuning of the numerical model. It is important to identify the correct parameter(s) for modification. A simplified and idealized case study is also carried out to test the requirements to a successful parameter identification for model tuning. Copyright © 2020 ASME},

	abstract = {The software model of beam pumping unit was built through the physical simulation pumping unit lifting system in the Internet of Things laboratory, and the lifting model was updated after mutual verification to form the digital twin system of oil and gas production lifting. Based on the digital twin of beam pumping unit and the real-time data of oil and gas production, the whole process of oil and gas lifting process production is formed, and a flexible closed-loop control method based on the digital twin is obtained. The method is based on the detailed and in-depth analysis of the whole movement, which selecting the load as the monitoring physical quantity, and improving the system efficiency. The method is to change the maximum and minimum load, reduce the input power and improve the system efficiency under the condition of maintaining a certain output. By comparing and analyzing the indicator diagram of oil well production before and after the flexible control, the flexible control method based on digital twin reduces the loss of mechanical operation and saves the consumption of electric energy, so that the efficiency of the pumping unit's lifting system reaches the maximum. At the same time, the control and analysis method based on digital twinning is a self-diagnosis, adjustment and control method of intelligent ecology, which is the inevitable trend of the development of intelligent oilfield.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate a cost-effective, user-friendly and highly reliable subsea pipeline and subsea structure design automation method developed on a cloud-based digital field twin platform. The FEED and detail design phase of the subsea pipeline and subsea structures are normally quite long and need to run several analyses sequentially to achieve the desired results. In this cloud-based design automation method, a significant number of calculation hours are saved due to systematic and sequential approach with minimum remediation work by reducing human error. In this proposed design automation framework, all the standard pipeline and subsea structure design calculations including code checks based on design standards are performed through a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) designed in cloud-based digital field twin. In the design phase of the subsea pipeline, some more advanced level pipeline finite element analyses are performed for buckling and walking assessment. The design phase of the subsea pipeline consists of different analytical as well as finite element (FE) calculations which are performed systematically and sequentially in cloud-based digital field twin. Various pipeline engineering calculations are performed sequentially and systematically in the cloud using the metadata information available from the digital field data. Some of the standard engineering calculations implemented in the digital field twin are wall thickness calculation (based on design standards), on-bottom stability analysis, span analysis, pipe end expansion analysis, pipeline global buckling analysis etc. All the standard pipeline and subsea structure design calculations are developed in python, which is connected to the cloud-based digital twin through API. For advanced FE analyses for lateral buckling and pipeline walking, the preliminary susceptibilities are assessed through analytical calculations developed through python-based API. For the pipeline FE analysis for lateral buckling and walking assessment, pre-processor and postprocessor are developed in python based on various metadata (pipe data, soil, environment) information available in the subsea digital field. The pipeline design calculation outputs are stored in a standardised report format in the cloud platform. The proposed GUI developed for the pipeline and structural design automation is user friendly and the whole process is automated through the python API. This design automation approach significantly reduces the total project cost. Digital Field Twin integrate all the subsea pipeline and structural design calculations and automate the report generation. The proposed digital field twin is very much beneficial for the early stages in the projects where some changes are expected. © 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {A conceptual design of digital Intelligent Production Integrity Operating Windows (IP-IOW) system, which is an unique and transformational solution to the oil and gas offshore industry focusing on maximizing production while optimizing equipment operation, was developed through a Nippon Foundation (NF)-DeepStar® partnership project. This connects the fluids system with the equipment system using IP-IOW architecture and specifications of a digital platform. The developed digital IP-IOW architecture contains five major evaluation modules, which are Component risk analysis (CRA), Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), Failure Evaluation (FE), Maintenance Evaluation (ME), and Reliability Availability, and Maintainability Analysis (RAMA) focusing on critical components, including subsea choke, flowline and riser, topside choke, topside equipment, and crude export line. Each module has a function of monitoring, risk evaluation or analysis of each component based on various existing databases and/or industrial standards. Component risk analysis (CRA) module is designed as a key module to evaluate individual risk of each component based on the evaluation results of the other modules and to provide IP-IOW dashboards through operation and maintenance analysis methods. CRA module analyzes operation and maintenance based on the likelihood of failure (probability of failure) as a function of operation and maintenance conditions and impact of the damage. Calculated safety operating windows (SOWs) and reliability operating windows (ROWs) would be indicated on the IP-IOW dashboard. In this project, detailed gap analysis was also conducted to gain an understanding of what relevant industry standards and practices have been published and how these publications have gaps with respect to IP-IOW. A completed search was made of technical indices and reference sources to identify codes and standards that may or can be used for developing Integrity Operating Windows (IOWs) for topside fixed equipment. Current API, DNV, and EI applicable recommended practices (RP) cover damaging effect, in-service inspection, risk ranking, repair items prioritization, and alteration of fixed equipment systems. However, the RPs do not cover how to integrate industry best practices into a real-time digital operating environment that is integral to the next generation O&M system. A critical recommendation is to connect the systems digitally allowing for data analytics using the Digital Twin of the asset. Several case studies on module development were conducted to demonstrate an example of the module development process and the workflow of module. RAM analysis on one of selected offshore production facilities identified top 30 high risk components from around 1200 components. A pilot physical model was also developed to enable the embodiment of a new industry recommended practice for offshore large scale of FPSO asset. This conceptual pilot has used the topside choke sand erosion connecting the fluid characterization (multi-phase flow) with the selected equipment to develop the correlation addressing major technical challenges of fixed equipment while maximizing production. An example of validation results of erosion module showed good agreement between actual inspection results and CFD calculation results. Overall, IP-IOW is designed based on rigorous CFD and field data to predict critical section of system and/or equipment likelihood of failure (LOF), such as Erosion with solids, flow induced vibration (FIV), acoustic induced vibration (AIV), vortex induced vibration (VIV), and corrosion in offshore environment. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) has been sponsored by Nippon Foundation (NF) and DeepStar (DS) Joint Ocean Innovation R&D Program to perform a research study (Phase 1) of project titled "19143 Fixed Equipment Integrity Operating Windows based on Facility Operating Conditions" started from May 2019. © 2021, Offshore Technology Conference.

	abstract = {The increase in Power Electronic (PE) converters due to the increase in offshore wind energy deployment have given rise to technical challenges (e.g., due to unprecedented fast dynamic phenomena) related to voltage and frequency stability in the power system. In the Offshore Wind Farms (OWFs), the currently available current injection-based voltage control for PE converters are not suitable for voltage control in PE dominated systems due to the absence of continuous voltage control and ineffectiveness during islanding. Moreover, in such power systems, the conventional controllers are not suitable for frequency control due to the absence of dynamic frequency control. The paper presents the Direct Voltage Control (DVC) strategy in a real-time environment to mitigate challenges related to voltage and frequency stability during islanding of OWFs. The control strategy is implemented in the average Electro-magnetic Transient (EMT) model of Type-4 Wind Generator (WG) in RSCAD® Version 5.011.1. It is compared with the benchmark model of the control strategy in DIgSILENT PowerFactory™ 2019 SP2 (×64) in EMT platform. The comparison based on shortterm voltage stability and reactive current injection reveals that both the models provide similar results, confirming the validation of the RSCAD model. Moreover, the detailed representation of the converters in the RSCAD model provides a better depiction of the real-world operation. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The load-carrying capability of marine steel structures often suffers degradation and at times structural failure during their service life due to the corrosive sea environment and the extreme wave loads which they experience. Structural integrity is a high priority during asset design and operation to preserve human safety, environment protection, and to maintain operations. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), a process of deriving the health status and predicting structural damage via sensor-based measurements, data trending and analysis, has been commonly implemented in marine and offshore assets for decades. There are mature commercial SHM products on the market and available international and industrial regulations, guidance and classification rules (such as IMO MSC/ Circ. 646, ABS Guide for Hull Condition Monitoring Systems, etc.). With the emergence of the Structural Digital Twin (SDT) concept in the marine industry in the recent years, the application of structural sensors on marine structures and the integration between sensor-based SHM techniques and structural digital twin approaches have attracted more attention. As a digital representation of the physical asset, the structural digital twin typically involves multiple-scale, multiple-physics, and data driven models and simulations. Leveraging the high fidelity full-scale SHM data, the structural digital twin is capable to provide more accurate assessments, predictions, and insights on structural integrity conditions and support the decision-making process regarding asset operation, structural inspection, repairs, and condition-based asset integrity management. This paper reviews the mature and commonly employed SHM sensor techniques (such as electric resistance strain gauge, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) strain gauge, accelerometer, pressure transducer, etc.) and discusses their implementation on marine assets and integration with structural digital twin. The paper elaborates to provide some general guidance on the selection of the structural sensors and their installation, as well as the proper sensor specification, in the context of a structural digital twin implementation. The paper also discusses the required engineering mindsets and skillsets for developing and deploying sensor plans, and for implementing a sensor-based structural digital twin framework. The paper concludes that a successful SHM plan and structural digital twin implementation rely on sensor planning, data acquisition, data processing, analytic models and a proper integration of the data and data analytics. The overall planning and implementation should be governed by the suitability for the business purpose and implementation expectation. Copyright 2020, Offshore Technology Conference},

	abstract = {We present a structural digital twin system based on component-based parametric reduced order modeling using Reduced Basis Finite Element Analysis (RB-FEA) framework. This enables fast, detailed, and holistic modeling of large-scale structures, such as floating and fixed production and drilling platforms, and crucially, the digital twin's parametric nature and fast solve time enables the system to be connected seamlessly with inspection and sensor data. We demonstrate RB-FEA based structural digital twins, and capabilities for connecting them to sensor data and data science methods to increase predictive power and engineering insight. We show how the digital twin is a key enabler for a Digital Thread- A data-driven architecture that links together information generated from across the product lifecycle. Inspection data, such as thickness measurements, can be directly mapped into the structural digital twin. Sensor data, such as motion and strain can be transformed into loading data, e.g. to estimate sea-states and calculate stress and fatigue accumulation based on actual conditions, or to "tune" model parameters to match data-based measurements, such as mode shapes and frequencies. This enables continuous tracking of the asset and assessment of its current state, based on quantitative and detailed structural analysis, at any time. Ultimately the structural digital twin provides an interpretation layer for integration of monitoring and inspection data, leading to a fully automated digital thread. We present a framework, based on a cloud-based simulation platform and Python-based scripting, to automate the workflows listed above. Digital twin provides a single source of truth about asset condition and allows data driven communication and decision taking between multiple stakeholders-operators, contractors, regulators, etc. We will show examples of real-world applications of RB-FEA digital twin for FPSO and Jacket platforms and development work for digital thread with emphasis on data driven value creation along the entire life cycle of the asset. The Reduced Basis FEA based structural digital twin is a key enabler of data driven digital thread in addition to sensor frameworks and data science systems. RB-FEA provides fast, parametric, and physicsbased analysis providing a transparent interpretation layer for data obtained from other systems. It provides a key element allowing knowledge management along asset lifecycle-from concept to decommissioning. High fidelity, physics based global simulations, such as RB-FEA digital twins, are a key enabler for effective digital transformation of industrial operations. They enable real-time insights into asset performance that are otherwise unattainable, providing tools for Asset Integrity Management, Risk Based Inspection, Automation and Optimization of Operations as well as enabling full digital thread enhancing Safety and CAPEX and OPEX. © 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {Companies in the oil and gas industry have, since the fall in oil price in 2014, been under pressures to cut costs and improve the effectiveness of their operations. Digitalization is generally considered as an important contributor to achieve this. One barrier to benefit from digitalization that is increasingly being recognized by the industry is data silos. Digital twin is a concept that has been proposed to alleviate this problem, but there is a lack of common understanding of what this concept entails and the potential benefits of this concept. To gain a better understanding of how digital twins are used for maintenance and safety in the offshore oil and gas industry, we have conducted a survey in the form of a web-based questionnaire among practitioners from this industry. 15 responses to the questionnaire was included in the final sample. Nine of these where from respondents that reported to have implemented digital twins in their own organization or in their products or services. Because of the low number of responses, the results cannot be used to draw conclusion on the current state of digital twins for maintenance and safety in the offshore oil and gas industry in general. But the results offer some insights that can be useful for further research. © ESREL 2021. Published by Research Publishing, Singapore.},

	abstract = {Flexible pipes have a range of potential failure modes, however fatigue damage of the tensile, and eventually, the pressure armour, is one of the most common problems affecting the longevity of service life and the OPEX due to the common need for flexible riser replacement. With increasing utilisation of flexible pipe for current and future field developments, compounded by the recurrent need for field life extension, it is essential to monitor the riser fatigue regularly to maintain integrity, maximise asset life and to allow for informed appraisal before extending its operational life. This paper presents a novel method of using the refined finite element analysis (FEA) in combination with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to develop a riser digital twin that can be utilised as an operational decision-making tool for integrity management and life extension. A digital twin model is trained on a subset of available metocean and vessel motion data utilising advanced neural networks which can then be utilised to predict fatigue under the full spectrum of metocean and internal pressure conditions. This approach allows for a significant reduction in the estimation time of the fatigue damage compared to conventional FEA as well as improved accuracy of prediction. The methodology presented in the paper has been primarily developed with the view of deepwater riser applications but is easily adaptable to shallow water application in combination with various floating vessels. A case study is presented to demonstrate how this technology is being deployed offshore. A comparison of FEA and digital twin approach is also presented to highlight the speed and efficiency of digital twin model whereby real-time insights on fatigue life can be evaluated for informed operational decisions.

	abstract = {In recent years, the oil and gas industry has gained greater operational efficiencies and productivity by deploying advanced technologies, such as smart sensors, data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning — all linked via Internet of Things connectivity. This transformation is profound, but just starting. Leading offshore E&P operators envision using such applications to help drive their production costs to as low as $7 per barrel or less. A large North Sea operator among them successfully deployed a low-manned platform in the Ivar Aasen field in December 2016, operating it via redundant control rooms — one on the platform, the other onshore 1,000 kilometers away in Trondheim, Norway. In January 2019, the offshore control room operators handed over the platform's control to the onshore operators, and it is now managed exclusively from the onshore one. One particular application — remote condition monitoring of equipment — supports a proactive, more predictive condition-based maintenance program, which is helping to ensure equipment availability, maximize utilization, and find ways to improve performance. This paper will explain the use case in greater detail, including insights into how artificial intelligence and machine learning are incorporated into this operational model. Also described will be the application of a closed-loop lifecycle platform management model, using the concepts of digital twins from pre-FEED and FEED phases through construction, commissioning, and an expected lifecycle spanning 20 years of operations. It is derived from an update to a paper presented at the 2018 SPE Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) that introduced the use case in its 2017-18 operating model, but that was before the debut of the platform's exclusive monitoring of its operations by its onshore control room.

	abstract = {Most drilling operations in deep water are performed in Dynamic Positioning (DP) mode. In harsh environments and shallow water conditions, thruster assisted position mooring configurations are often the preferred choice as the mooring lines provide an extra help to counteract the environmental loads. Drilling operations, both in pure DP or thruster-assisted position mooring modes, are limited by the ability of the vessel to maintain position and heading within the required accuracy. In addition, the motion in heave, roll and pitch must be within predefined limits. These limits vary between the type of operation to be performed. For example, reconnecting the low marine riser package has much stricter motion limitations compared to logging or drilling through riser operations. All these operations need to be carefully planned; and having estimate in advance of the vessel motion and station-keeping performance could be of vital importance, also considering planned maintenance. The aim of this paper is to share experiences in planning DP drilling operations by using cloud-based time-domain simulations performed with a digital twin of a semi-submersible drilling rig. A digital twin is a virtual representation of an asset, used from early design through building and operations, maintained and easily accessible throughout its lifecycle. A digital twin can replicate many aspects of the asset; in the case of planning DP drilling operations, our digital twin includes time-domain models for running simulations and predicting the vessel motion.

	abstract = {For decades, upstream personnel have struggled to efficiently gather offshore data and effectively analyze it to make better business decisions. One internal audit conducted by an oil and gas company found its upstream employees spent up to 80 percent of their time just looking for, then converting the data because the data historically has not been housed in one place within one platform. Traditionally, employees must collect large volumes of information from multiple data sources, including spreadsheets, data streams or tacit knowledge. Alone, the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors connected to equipment in the field can send 1,000 readings a minute to engineers, resulting in an insurmountable data for engineers to assess critically. All of this effort results in underutilized time and loss of money. The paper's topic addresses the digital twin technology solution which solves energy company's Big Data problems and recoups the wasted time and associated costs of field workers looking for data. Specifically, FutureOn's FieldTwin technology offers a cloud-based, comprehensive and secure platform with the ability to break up the barriers of the data silos built by legacy systems, creating accessible data across the company. Employees spend less time searching for data, and more time identifying trends and innovative ways to exploit the data, i.e., smarter drilling, greater field automation or improved safety. FieldTwin technology also provides a real-time, data-driven visual representation of the field that creates actionable data, whether it is an operator using the visualization of its subsea assets for field expansions or a renewable company utilizing the digitalization of its offshore wind projects for more effective planning. Studies show humans respond to and process visual data better than any other type of data. The human brain processing images 60,000 times faster than text, and 90 percent of information transmitted to the brain is visual. FieldTwin exploits this reality to enhance data processing and organizational effectiveness spanning project management to risk management in the field. © 2019, Offshore Technology Conference},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a great deal of discussion surrounding the opportunities presented by digitalization in offshore oil and gas. However, despite the increased attention, operators have received little direction from digital solutions providers on how to fully capitalize on its benefits. This paper will aim to change that by providing a blueprint for adopting a digital lifecycle approach to offshore oil and gas production. The approach presented in this paper, which we will refer to as Topsides 4.0 for ease of reference, is an integrated digital lifecycle approach to rotating equipment and electrical and automation systems, underpinned by secure communications. The approach is designed to enable digital design and manufacturing, virtual testing and commissioning, and delivery of an intelligent "digital twin" of a topsides facility. The digital twin is a virtual replica that mirrors the physical facility in near real-time, thus providing a number of advantages to offshore O&G producers, including the capability to run virtual what-if scenarios on the asset and better understand how process, equipment, and maintenance would be impacted by different operating conditions. Additionally, the paper will address challenges and concerns associated with digitalization in offshore O&G production, such as cybersecurity. It will also outline expected cost and schedule savings that topsides operators can achieve by embracing a fully digitalized approach, some of which include 3-9 month reduction in cycle times, $10 - $15 million reduction in CAPEX, and $100 million reduction in OPEX over a 10-year period. © 2018, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {The assessment of anthropogenic impacts on the marine environment is challenged by the accessibility, accuracy and validity of biogeographical information. Offshore wind farm projects require large-scale ecological surveys before, during and after construction, in order to assess potential effects on the distribution and abundance of protected species. The robustness of site-specific population estimates depends largely on the extent and design of spatial coverage and the accuracy of the applied census technique. Standard environmental assessment studies in Germany have so far included aerial visual surveys to evaluate potential impacts of offshore wind farms on seabirds and marine mammals. However, low flight altitudes, necessary for the visual classification of species, disturb sensitive bird species and also hold significant safety risks for the observers. Thus, aerial surveys based on high-resolution digital imagery, which can be carried out at higher (safer) flight altitudes (beyond the rotor-swept zone of the wind turbines) have become a mandatory requirement, technically solving the problem of distant-related observation bias. A purpose-assembled imagery system including medium-format cameras in conjunction with a dedicated geo-positioning platform delivers series of orthogonal digital images that meet the current technical requirements of authorities for surveying marine wildlife at a comparatively low cost. At a flight altitude of 425 m, a focal length of 110 mm, implemented forward motion compensation (FMC) and exposure times ranging between 1/1600 and 1/1000 s, the twin-camera system generates high quality 16 bit RGB images with a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 2 cm and an image footprint of 155 × 410 m. The image files are readily transferrable to a GIS environment for further editing, taking overlapping image areas and areas affected by glare into account. The imagery can be routinely screened by the human eye guided by purpose-programmed software to distinguish biological from non-biological signals. Each detected seabird or marine mammal signal is identified to species level or assigned to a species group and automatically saved into a geo-database for subsequent quality assurance, geo-statistical analyses and data export to third-party users. The relative size of a detected object can be accurately measured which provides key information for species-identification. During the development and testing of this system until 2015, more than 40 surveys have produced around 500.000 digital aerial images, of which some were taken in specially protected areas (SPA) of the Baltic Sea and thus include a wide range of relevant species. Here, we present the technical principles of this comparatively new survey approach and discuss the key methodological challenges related to optimizing survey design and workflow in view of the pending regulatory requirements for effective environmental impact assessments.},

They need to easily access and consolidate all the data intuitively to quickly figure out the overall situation and thus identify faster the dangers related to the integrity of their assets. Bureau Veritas and Dassault Systèmes have engaged in a two-year development partnership to address these challenges with a new generation of Asset Integrity Management System powered by the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. At the heart of this solution, a 3DEXPERIENCE twin of the assets enables to connect data coming from the real world to the asset integrity analysis in the digital world through 3D visualization and data analytics at any level (from unitary structural members up to the entire asset) made available to all stakeholders. This paper will present how this new Bureau Veritas solution can optimize the lifecycle of assets through the following main capabilities: 3D model creation and lifecycle management, asset integrity monitoring, interoperability with information systems (ERP, CMMS, DMS ...), interventions planning, and integration of interventions results and findings in the 3D model. Beyond the software functionalities, both partners are convinced that it will serve as a business digital transformation catalyst. This solution will enable comprehensive RBI of the hull structure as each individual element is tracked with its current or foreseeable degradation, thus enabling better and faster maintenance and repair decisions, therefore saving time and money. © 2017: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.},

	abstract = {In this work we discuss new capabilities for structural integrity analysis of critical offshore assets such as semi-submersibles and FPSOs that are enabled by Reduced Basis FEA (RB-FEA) coupled with Fast Full Load Mapping to enable high-fidelity Digital Twins. RB-FEA is a new structural simulation framework based on component-based model order reduction, in which (i) a large model is decomposed into components, (ii) each component is endowed with parameters which enable geometric, material, and/or load data to be modified on the fly, (iii) a reduced order model of each component (valid for the entire parameter range) is prepared based on an automated pre-analysis of individual components and groups of components, and (iv) component-based models are assembled and solved very efficiently due to re-use of the reduced order model data. For large models this framework enables orders-of-magnitude increase in model detail and solver speed compared to conventional FEA, without sacrificing accuracy. Fast Full Load Mapping obtains full distributive loads acting on a floating body in random waves at costs of conventional global performance analyses, without any costly CFD. In time domain, these full distributive loads are fed into RB-FEA, and the combination of these two powerful approaches enables new capabilities for detailed hydrodynamic and structural analysis of critical offshore assets. We demonstrate these capabilities with some illustrative examples. Copyright © 2018 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE)},

	abstract = {The reduced basis finite element analysis (RB-FEA) technology was utilized for performing structural analyses of a semisubmersible drilling rig. The digital twin of the drilling rig based on the RB-FEA technology is about 1000 times faster to analyze than a conventional FEA model, without any compromise in the accuracy of the solution. The global model was established by integrating the individual components of the RB-FEA model with associated material properties, loads, and boundary conditions. The software for mapping of the wave loads (generated by software such as WAMIT/WADAM) onto the hull structure of the drilling rig was developed. Time domain strength and fatigue analyses were then performed for the whole structure that also included the highly refined fatigue sensitive regions of the drilling rig. The results from the study demonstrated the efficiency and the accuracy of the RB-FEA based technology. The speedup and level of detail achieved through the RB-FEA technology is a key enabler for the digital twin technology since it enables true condition-based modeling of large and critical assets, allowing all relevant structural details to be included in the model, along with sensor and inspection-based condition data such as cracks, corrosion, and damage due to impact or collision. Asset life extension - enabled by the digital twin and condition-based monitoring using sensor systems - is the key to capitalizing on the value of existing facilities that are operating near (or beyond) their original design life. © 2018, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {The concept of the digital twin dates all the way back to the 1950's when NASA, GE and other industrial manufacturers started creating abstract digital models of equipment to model their performance in simulations and maintain a record of the asset throughout its life span [1]. Over the years more and more industries have adopted the digital twin paradigm to improve traceability, maintenance, and analytics allowing for improved sustainment of the asset or equipment while reducing various risks identified during life cycle management. It has been found that collectively, the digital twin concept improves the overall net present value of an asset. The oil and gas industry has slowly been adopting the digital twin paradigm of asset life cycle management over the past two decades with the focus on facilities. Recently, field trials were completed to test and evaluate workflows and sensor platforms for the creation of a digital twin for pipelines. The trials resulted in highly accurate pipeline centerlines, weld locations, Depth to Cover (DoC) and ditch geometry capture in digital formats. This paper describes the methodologies used, and the results of an actual construction field trial with a comparison to traditional data collection methods for these attributes. The value of creating a pipeline digital twin during pipeline construction in near-real-time is discussed with an emphasis on the potential benefits to life cycle management and pipeline integrity.

	abstract = {Peregrino is a field offshore Brazil with a FPSO and 2 fixed platforms currently producing close to 100 000 stb/d of oil. Production wells are equipped with electric submersible pumps (ESP) and all produced water is reinjected back into the reservoir using 6 injectors for pressure support. The viscosity of the crude is high (163 cp at reservoir conditions). The present work explores the merits and provides the development details of a model-based production optimization scheme to advice on the best frequency settings of the ESPs in each well. This to ensure the maximum amount possible of oil is produced when water injection capacity is a bottleneck. Furthermore, it studies how the optimal operating conditions change with time. The optimization formulation considers maximization of total oil production, the maximum allowable water produced given by the available injection capacity and the operational constraints of the ESPs. The optimization was formulated as a Mixed-Integer Linear Problem (MILP). The performance of the wells is represented with piecewise linear tables generated from a commercial simulator. For the cases tested, the proposed optimization scheme works successfully: It has low running times suitable for real time production optimization, handles successfully multiple operational constraints, and guarantees global optimality. Optimization results are presented for future times. By using piecewise linear tables to represent the well performances the fidelity of the original model is maintained, while ensuring a robust and fast optimization of the problem.

	abstract = {Oil & Gas data currently exists within a world of data silos. Lack of data is not the challenge. A wide variety of data is collected, including sensor values, P&IDs, ERP, and depth-based trajectories. Rather, the challenge pertains to data usefulness. The root of the problem is a combination of factors, including poor data infrastructure, incompatible operational data systems, and restricted data access. All this translates to a low maturity of digitalization across the Oil & Gas industry. To date, digitalization efforts have been limited to pilot projects, proofs of concept and case studies, with no large-scale operationalized projects. Aker BP, one of Europe's largest independent Oil & Gas companies, has broken through the typical roadblocks by deploying an industrial data platform across all five of its operational assets. The platform aggregates and processes data from sensors and contextualizes it, structuring it in relation to process diagrams, production information, 3D-models, and event data (maintenance, incidents). Everything linked in the real world is also linked in the platform. This has dramatically reduced the cost of integration and maintenance, while simultaneously enabling scalability, speed of development, and data openness throughout the Aker BP organization. The data platform handles live and historical data for close to 200,000 sensors, with a peak transfer of 800,000 data points per second. Internal and external experts are able to apply state-of-the-art algorithms to visualize and solve critical business problems. A range of third-party applications and data scientists also use the 1+ trillion data points in the platform to create value and support Aker BP's strategy for day-to-day operations and long-term digital transformation. To realize the promise of digitalization, unlocking the value of data must be made a priority within the Oil & Gas industry. This paper will describe the implementation of the industrial data platform, explaining how data streamed from many, disparate, underlying systems is contextualized in the data platform to provide a holistic view of all processes and operations, thus creating a foundational digital twin for each asset, ready to empower machine learning applications for optimization and automatization, as well as human-facing applications, such as advanced visualizations and apps for the digital field worker.

	abstract = {A digital twin is a virtual representation of a system containing all information available on site. This paper presents condition monitoring of drivetrains in marine power transmission systems through digital twin approach. A literature review regarding current operations concerning maintenance approaches in todays practices are covered. State-of-the-art fault detection in drivetrains is discussed, founded in condition monitoring, data-based schemes and model-based approaches, and the digital twin approach is introduced. It is debated that a model-based approach utilizing a digital twin could be recommended for fault detection of drivetrains. By employing a digital twin, fault detection would be extended to relatively highly diagnostic and predictive maintenance programme, and operation and maintenance costs could be reduced. A holistic model system approach is considered, and methodologies of digital twin design are covered. A physical-based model rather than a data based model is considered, however there are no clear answer whereas which type is beneficial. That case is mostly answered by the amount of data available. Designing the model introduces several pitfalls depending on the relevant system, and the advantages, disadvantages and appropriate applications are discussed. For a drivetrain it is found that multi-body simulation is advised for the creation of a digital twin model. A digital twin of a simple drivetrain test rig is made, and different modelling approaches were implemented to investigate levels of accuracy. Reference values were derived empirically by attaching sensors to the drivetrain during operation in the test rig. Modelling with a low fidelity model showed high accuracy, however it would lack several modules required for it to be called a digital twin. The higher fidelity model showed that finding the stiffness parameter proves challenging, due to high stiffness sensitivity as the experimental modelling demonstrates. Two industries that could have significant benefits from implementing digital twins are discussed; the offshore wind industry and shipping. Both have valuable assets, with reliability sensitive systems and high costs of downtime and maintenance. Regarding the shipping industry an industrial case study is done. Area of extra focus is operations of Ro-Ro (roll onroll off) vessels. The vessels in the case study are managed by Wilhelmsen Ship Management and a discussion of the implementation of digital twins in this sector is comprised in this article. © 2019 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

	abstract = {The Murihiku 1:250 000 geological map covers 18 000 km2 of south Otago and Southland, in the South Island of New Zealand, and includes Stewart Island (Rakiura). Topography varies from flat-topped ranges and intervening basins in northern Southland, to prominent strike ridge topography of the Kaihiku, Hokonui, and North ranges, the jagged Takitimu Mountains, the lower bushclad Longwood and Twinlaw massifs, and the extensive Southland Plains. Stewart Island has generally subdued bush and scrub-covered topography, with rolling hills and the swampy Freshwater Depression in the centre. Numerous other offshore islands dot the shallow waters of Foveaux Strait and the fringes of Stewart Island. The Waiau Basin lies in the far southwest, on the eastern edge of Fiordland. The map area covers a wide range of Paleozoic to Mesozoic rocks which form parts of several tectonostratigraphic terranes. The Paleozoic to Cretaceous Median Batholith comprises gabbroic to granitic plutonic rocks that intrude metamorphic rocks of the Takaka terrane on Stewart Island and the Permian oceanic volcanic island arc sequence of the Brook Street terrane in the Takitimu and Longwood ranges, and at Bluff. Late Permian to Jurassic Murihiku terrane sedimentary rocks separate Brook Street and Dun Mountain-Maitai terranes and underlie most of the map area, thrust over Brook Street terrane in the west and faulted against Dun Mountain '- Maitai terrane along the northeastern limb of the regional Southland Syncline. The Dun Mountain-Maitai terrane is in turn faulted against the Caples terrane in the northeastern corner of the map area. Dun Mountain - Maitai terrane rocks represent an Early Permian ophiolite complex, overlain by metasediments of Permian to Triassic age. The Caples terrane is probably of Permian to Triassic age in the map area. Except on Stewart Island, these basement terranes are overlain by discontinuously preserved Cretaceous and more extensive Eocene and younger sedimentary rocks of the Ohai, Nightcaps, Waiau and East Southland groups. The contact is the widespread Late Cretaceous to Cenozoic Waipounamu Erosion Surface in northern Southland. The fault-controlled Cenozoic Waiau Basin contains up to 5 km of marine and non-marine clastic sedimentary rocks; coeval but much thinner shelf sedimentary rocks, typically limestones, extend beneath the Winton and Eastern Southland basins and the Waimea Plains. Quaternary glaciation in Fiordland and northern Southland produced large volumes of gravel which accumulated in the Waimea and Southland Plains, the latter also influenced by marine sedimentation during interglacial high sea levels. Cirque glaciation affected the Takitimu and probably Longwood ranges, and glaciers also formed on Mt Anglern and Mt Allen on Stewart Island. In northern Southland, at Gore and at Orepuki, Quaternary deposits (including beach placers at Orepuki) have produced at least 8000 kg of alluvial gold. Lode systems are preserved in the volcanic rocks around the Longwood Range but few have been mined. Platinum group metals have been mined and prospected for in the Longwood Range. Non-metallic minerals include limestone, sub-bituminous coal at Ohai, and large reserves of lignite in the East Southland Group. The Murihiku map area is subject to seismic hazard from the Alpine Fault west of Fiordland, and active faults in Central Otago and Western Southland, with associated earthquake shaking, landsliding, ground rupture, liquefaction and delta collapse. Landslides and rockfalls, both during and independent of major rainstorms, are minor but ongoing hazards. Tsunami, mine collapse and flooding are more localised hazards. © Copyright Institute of Geological & Nuclear Sciences Limited 2003.},

	abstract = {Objective of the paper is to describe and present results of using a "Digital Twin" in Drilling Operations (Planning and Engineering, Training and Operational Support) in the last 10 years for Operators worldwide. The concept of Digital Twin was first introduced by Michael Grieves at the University of Michigan in 2003 through Grieves' Executive Course on Product Lifecycle Management. Winning a Formula 1 race is no longer just about building the fastest car, hiring the bravest driver and praying for luck. These days, when a McLaren technology group races in Monaco or Singapore, it beams data from hundreds of sensors wired in the car to Woking, England. There, analysts study that data and use complex computer models to relay optimal race strategies back to the driver. The McLaren race crew and the online retailers both harness data and use algorithms to make reasonable projections about the future, Parris explains. The concept is called Digital Twin [1]. A Digital Twin contains information such as a piece of equipment or asset, including its physical description, instrumentation, data and history. A Digital Twin can be created for assets ranging from a well to a piece of equipment to an entire oilfield. For example, a subsea system could have a Digital Twin via a simulation model of a subsea system's components, including the blowout preventer, tiebacks, risers, manifolds, umbilical and moorings. Drilling and extracting simulations can determine whether virtual designs can actually be built using the machines available," GE said. "Last but not least, real-time data feeds from sensors in a physical operating asset are now used to know the exact state and condition of an operating-asset product, no matter where it is in the world"[2]. © 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

	abstract = {While there is a lot of talk about Big Data Analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Real Time Monitoring (RTM), Digital Twin and other methodologies, all of them require, not only data, but accurate, reliable data. This paper describes a new and innovative inspection methodology that combines 3D laser scanning and precise 3D Geometric Dimensioning & Tolerancing (GD&T) metrology data with advanced Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) results. This data is then combined in digital 3D space to give an accurate representation of current equipment condition and mechanical integrity of critical offshore assets. Such inspection and testing can be conducted during manufacturing as a quality check, creating digital baseline records, or on deck during operations, saving significant downtime and costs. By including metrology and phased array, the described inspection methodology can provide precise digital data and specialized 3D reports that will satisfy not only compliance and regulatory efforts in a more objective manner, but also assist original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), drilling contractors and operators by supplying conclusive and accurate data of equipment condition. This data, based on in-situ NDT and Geometric Dimensioning & Tolerancing measurement information, will support Digital Twin data and operational and maintenance decisions that will preserve the integrity, safety, and availability of the assets. This innovative inspection solution can form part of a Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) program where operators can move from time-based programs and use the digital data to determine future equipment performance, work scope, and schedules while maintaining a complete and updated digital condition record throughout the lifecycle of the equipment. The program may predict and prevent problems at early stages, provide strategies that will simplify maintenance activities, and potentially identify manufacturing flaws. More importantly, it can create historical digital data that will change the way the drilling industry operates and satisfy what regulatory agencies have been seeking since the implementation of the new well control rule. © 2019, Offshore Technology Conference},

	abstract = {In recent years, hot topics such as digitalization, machine learning, digital twin and big data have evolved from being envisions on the paper to state of art solutions, expected to revolutionize drilling efficiency in the industry. Drilling automation tomorrow is all about exploiting the current state of technologies available to the entire operation of drilling a well. Not only can drilling automation limit costs and reduce the risk to rig personnel and the environment, but they also give access to locations of considerable potential that previously have been regarded unsafe or uneconomical to operate in. There are however some challenges in keeping up with the ever-increasing pace of the development. For one, testing of novel and innovative solutions is often very expensive because of non-productive rig time during implementation, trial runs and data evaluation. Also, the modern technologies require extensive R&D before on-site testing can even commence. While on land-rigs, some of these costs and risks can be greatly minimized, many offshore solutions lack that luxury. This paper presents an overview of the design principles that go into the construction of a fully autonomous laboratory-scale drilling rig at the University of Stavanger. It aims at describing 1) the engineering principles involved to resemble full-scale drilling operations on the laboratory scale, 2) design considerations and components, 3) component requirements for the rig, 4) control system algorithms for real-time optimization of drilling parameters and detection and handling of drilling anomalies, 5) development of drilling models (drill string dynamics, bit-vibration, etc.) and 6) benefits and future work with the laboratory-scale system.

The digital twin allows GE Oil & Gas to provide the driller with data-based diagnostics and insights into what is happening to the asset during a regular day or even during an extreme event, and then pick the most optimal way to run that asset. This marine riser digital twin will allow operators to maintain equipment in a more efficient manner. It can help reduce excessive maintenance and costs of the main tube for drilling contractors with a data-driven approach. The digital twin, or machine learning model, is a virtual model of the riser that is continuously updated against the sensor measurements and metocean conditions. When this data is beyond the original training conditions, a model retraining is automatically triggered. Visualization and alerts are provided by software, which ingests and performs advanced analytics on the field data enhance the operational decision-making for the drillers and operators. This continuous learning and update of the digital twin model allows us to provide more precise calculation of the riser fatigue life and enable optimizing operations in near real-time.},

	abstract = {In 2005, Petrobras created a corporate program named GeDIg, designed to guide and implement Digital Integrated Field Management among its production assets. The Barracuda and Caratinga (BRC) asset was chosen as one of Rio de Janeiro Business Unit pilots. This asset is composed of two offshore deep-water oil fields, where two twin FPSOs, P-43 and P-48, produce a total of approximately 200,000 bpd of oil, with an average density of 24° API. Management and technical teams from BRC are geographically dispersed among four different locations: the asset's headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, the logistics and operations base in Macae, a city located 190 km (118 miles) Northeast of Rio de Janeiro, and the two offshore production units, located about 160 km (100 miles) East of Macae. Collaborative environments (CE) were implemented in each site to connect and integrate those teams. The GeDIg-BRC pilot project, initiated in October 2006, was divided in five different areas: real time production operations monitoring, integrated planning, process design, change management, and collaborative environment design and construction. Also, during the earlier stages of the project, a business case was generated to identify, quantify and validate the expected benefits of the project. A major challenge faced during the implementation of the GeDIg-BRC solution, was making the whole integration proposed by the collaborative environments become a reality. The asset started using its collaborative environments in mid 2007, when process optimization initiatives and IT solutions development were still in progress, supported by a change management and communications program. Although several technical components and processes were planned to support managers and engineers on their daily operational activities, there wasn't any specific support tool for optimizing the collaborative environments utilization. That gap motivated the development of a customized solution, specifically designed to support some key processes, which run inside the asset's collaborative environments. The solution was named Collaborative Portal. This paper's objective is to describe the challenges faced by the asset's team and the lessons learned during the process of designing and effectively implementing the asset's Collaborative Environment and its customized support tool, the Collaborative Portal. This tool is successfully running since August 2008. It supports processes like the daily production monitoring meetings, gathering the asset manager and his key staff to efficiently and quickly monitor and control production status (KPIs), production losses, threats and opportunities, as well as defining, planning and following-up on preventive and corrective actions. It also supports other processes like anomalies prevention, customized meetings, visualization of offshore CCTV video cameras and manages the content of the asset's internal TV.

	abstract = {The paper presents a true digital twin concept, which is a general and novel methodology that significantly improves the fatigue prediction models of existing marine structures. The actual structural condition of existing marine platforms can often change after several years in operation due to degradation mechanisms and/or other structural changes. It is within this context, the true digital twin concept has been developed and the general idea is to create a coupling between the digital twin and measurements. The measurements are performed by Structural Health Monitoring Systems (SHMS). This coupling facilitates a direct performance evaluation of the digital twin against measurements and most importantly creates the basis for improving the performance of the digital twin to accurately capture the actual condition of the structure, and thus become a true digital twin. The full concept of creating a true digital twin encompass novel advanced analysis methods ranging from linear system identification, expansion processes, Bayesian FE model updating, wave load calibration, quantification of uncertainties from measured data, and Risk- and Reliability Based Inspection Planning (RBI) analysis, [1]. This paper presents the first 3 levels for establishing a true digital twin. The levels are illustrated by 3 case stories. Copyright © 2018 ASME.},

	abstract = {In 2011 78% of upstream oil & gas megaprojects faced either cost or schedule overruns according to an industry study by the Independent Project Analysis (Merrow, 2012). In 2014, research by EY found 64% of projects faced cost overruns (EY, 2014) and 73% of projects faced schedule overruns. In 2017 the UK Oil & Gas Authority (OGA) published a study of lessons learned from UKCS oil & gas projects between 2011-2016, which reported "since 2011 fewer than 25% of oil and gas projects have been delivered on time with projects averaging 10 months' delay and coming in around 35% over budget." (OGA, 2017) This level of cost and schedule underperformance was not sustainable in the high oil price economic environment and is inconceivable in the lower oil price environment in which we now operate. Both the EY and the OGA reports identify factors for these overruns and lessons that can be learned. These include organisational learnings, project management failings, inadequate planning and cognitive biases within the team. One of the key lessons identified in the OGA report was that high-quality Front-End Loading (FEL) is critical to project success. A successful FEL should develop sufficient strategic information to allow decisions to be made that maximise the chance of a successful project. As part of its unique approach to field development, which brings projects to market faster and with more certainty, we have created a methodology, based on the approach developed by Professor Ronald A. Howard at Stanford University, to deliver a high quality FEL. This methodology is underpinned by a number of unique tools and techniques and draws on best practice from a variety of industries, including aerospace, smart cities and software development. The methodology paves the way for a digital project execution and the evolution of an operational digital twin. © 2019, Offshore Technology Conference},

Three experiments were conducted to validate the XDD. On two successive days off the California coast, 10 XDDs and 14 Vaisala RD-94s were deployed from the navy's Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS) Twin Otter aircraft over offshore buoys. The Twin Otter made spiral descents from 4 km to 60 m at the same descent rate as the sondes. Differences between successive XDD and RD-94 profiles due to true meteorological variability were on the same order as the profile differences between the spirals, XDDs, and RD-94s. XDD SST measured via infrared microradiometer, referred to as infrared skin SST (SSTir), and surface wind measurements were within 0.5°C and 1.5 m s-1, respectively, of buoy and Twin Otter values. A NASA DC-8 flight launched six XDDs from 12 km between ex-TC Cosme and the Baja California coast. Repeatability was shown with good agreement between features in successive profiles. XDD SSTir measurements from 18° to 28°C and surface winds agreed well with drifting buoy- and satellite-derived estimates. Excellent agreement was found between PTH and wind profiles measured by XDDs deployed from a NASA WB-57 at 18-km altitude offshore from the Texas coast and NWS radiosonde profiles from Brownsville and Corpus Christi, Texas. Successful XDD profiles were obtained in the clear and within precipitation over an offshore squall line. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.},

Results indicate solutions to various problems currently observed in offshore exploration and reservoir development. From the beginning of the use of continuous towed arrays, marine seismic data has been acquired using multiple hydrophone groups arranged in streamer oables deployed at shallow uniform water depths. Flat streamer cables have typically been towed at nominal speeds of 4 to 6 knots to enable CRP data to be gathered as efficiently and noise free as possible. In the late 1970's, new Cable Levelers were developed allowing hydrophone depths to be controlled remotely from the recording vessel. This, coupled with the development of digital streamers, set the stage for hydrophone deployment at independently selected depths. © 1989 Society of Exploration Geophysicists. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Using accurate and high quality data is critical for any application relying heavily on the data, be it machine learning, artificial intelligence, or digital twins. Bad quality and erroneous data can result in inaccurate predictions even if the model is otherwise robust. Ensuring data quality is more critical in real-time applications where there is no human in the loop to perform sense checks on data or results. A real-time digital twin implementation for a floating system uses time-series data from numerous measurements such as wind, waves, GPS, vessel motions, mooring tensions, draft, etc. Statistics computed from the data are used in the digital twin. An extensive data checking and cleaning routine was written that performs data quality checks and corrections on the time series data before statistics are computed. Various types of errors that typically occur in a time series include noise, flat-lined data, clipped data, outliers, and discontinuities. Statistical procedures were developed to check the raw time-series for all these errors. The procedures are generic and robust so they can be used for different types of data. Some data types are slow varying (e.g., GPS) while the others are fast varying random processes. A measurement classified as an error in one type of data is not necessarily an error in the other data type. For example, GPS data can be discontinuous by nature but a discontinuity in the wave data indicates an error. Likewise, checking for white noise in mooring tension data is not that meaningful. We developed parametric data procedures so that the same routine can handle different types of data and their errors. Outlier removal routines use the standard deviation of the time-series which itself could be biased from errors. Therefore, a method to compute unbiased statistics from the raw data is developed and implemented for robust outlier removal. Extensive testing on years of measured data and on hundreds of data channels was performed to ensure that data cleaning procedures function as intended. Statistics (mean, standard deviations, maximum, and minimum) were computed from both the raw and cleaned data. Comparison showed significant differences in raw and cleaned statistics, with the latter obviously being more accurate. Data cleaning, while not sounding as high tech as other analytics algorithms, is a critical foundation of any data science application. Using cleaned time-series data and corresponding statistics ensure that a data analytics model provides actionable results. Clean data and statistics help achieve the intended purpose of the digital twin, which is to inform operators of the health/condition of the asset and flag any anomalous events. © 2019, Offshore Technology Conference},

	abstract = {Here, we present the R&D project Real-Time Digital Twin for Boosting Performance of Seismic Operations, which aims at increasing the overall operational efficiency of seismic vessels through digitisation and automation. The cornerstone in this project is the development of a real-time digital twin (RTDT)—a sophisticated mathematical model and state estimator of all the in-sea seismic equipment, augmented with real-time measurements from the actual equipment. This provides users and systems on-board the vessel with a live digital representation of the state of the equipment during operations. By combining the RTDT with state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and control theory, the project will develop new advisory and automation systems that improve the efficiency of seismic survey operations, reduce the risk of equipment damage, improve health monitoring and fault detection systems, and improve the quality of the seismic data. This will lead to less unproductive time, reduced costs, reduced fuel consumption and reduced emissions for a given operational scope. The main focus in this paper is the presentation of today’s challenges in offshore seismic surveys, and how state-of-the-art technology can be adopted to improve various operations. We discuss how simulation technology, machine learning and live sensor measurements can be integrated in on-board decision support and automation systems, and highlight the importance of such systems for designing the complex, autonomous offshore vessels of the future. Finally, we present some early results from the project in the form of two brief case studies. Copyright © 2019 ASME.},

This digital tool completely changed engineering in all phases of the project life cycle since its first use in 2015. Its unique capacity is to 'Engineer with the Human Factor in the loop' independent if this Human Factor is the client, designer, fabricator, marine warranty surveyor or the offshore operator. In the conventional engineering tools the Human Factor cannot be included and in the conventional engineering process the preparation is done by engineers without much involvement of the operators. It is as if engineering and execution are separate worlds. Being able to bring these worlds together efficiently in an early stage has already led to an efficiency improvement for all parties (i.e. client, fabricator and offshore operator) involved and has improved the Operational Excellence offshore. In this paper the results of three simulated cases will be described to explain the way the Digital Twin is used for different purposes and objectives and what sort of results can be achieved from 'Engineering with the Human Factor in the loop'. The Digital Twin is an exceptional tool in our Digital Journey that speeds up the process of implementing changes for a more efficient and safer offshore world. © 2019, Offshore Technology Conference},

	abstract = {Digital Twin is a new paradigm combining multiphysics modelling together with data-driven analytics. In recent years, it draws considerable interest from the oil and gas field operators due to lower oil prices to reduce the downtime due to planned or unplanned preventive maintenance in production field which cost several million in the operational cost (OPEX). The digital twin is an integrated system with low-cost IoT sensors to gather system data, advanced data analytics to draw meaningful insights and predictive maintenance strategy based on the machine learning algorithm to reduce preventive maintenance cost. Overall the digital twin act as a digital replica of the field asset which is monitored and maintained based on actual sensor data from the physical field using machine learning. This paper will demonstrate the conceptual design of a digital twin of subsea pipeline system integrating the computational model, field sensor data analytics and predictive maintenance based on the machine learning algorithm. The computational model is first developed in the finite element (FE) model and calibrated by the field sensor data installed on the physical system. The computational model will be used to predict any change of pipe behaviour due to sudden changes in loading due to high pressure, slugging or leak etc. The proposed digital twin model will assist the oil and gas field operators in minimizing the OPEX with predictive maintenance schedule when it's needed to avoid failure in the pipeline system.

	abstract = {                             The global energy industry is being radically transformed by increased access to data and digitalization of tools and processes. When data is harnessed effectively and then combined with engineering insight it has the ability to radically improve how energy assets are designed, operated and optimized from concept and front end design all the way through the life of the field to decommissioning. Aker Solutions has developed a data platform and series of software applications which together form a digital twin capable of optimizing energy operations at a product, facility and field level integrating subsea and topside facilities. The digital twin, conceived during the early concept phase (or retrofit to existing assets), draws together diverse data sources into an integrated format which can be managed and enriched as the asset progresses through its lifecycle. Software applications built on this platform include:                             •                              Using knowledge-based and adaptable building blocks, our early phase software application accelerates the development of concepts with the ability to rapidly explore different options and adjust and optimize to different customer driven variables                             •                              During detailed design phase, software applications are used to drive engineering automation and ensure that safety is built inherently into the design                             •                              Simulation software applications are used to test and evaluate complex installation operations in a virtual environment before any offshore operations take place                             •                              Digital twin can add significant value during operations and maintenance activities with performance and integrity data collated and visualized helping to make informed decisions to ensure production optimization and continuity                             •                              At a product level, Aker Solutions' connected subsea equipment uses software applications and analytics to perform condition monitoring and enable predictive maintenance, maximizing production uptime This digital thread allows data to seamlessly transition across asset phases enabling engineers, operators and asset managers to make informed and confident data-driven decisions; increasing efficiency, reducing cost and reducing risk.                          © Copyright 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

	abstract = {The use of a unique, data-driven approach to remote condition monitoring of equipment maintenance has enabled a major offshore E&P producer to build and operate a a low-manned platform - a key step in its strategic goal to reduce per-barrel production costs to below $7. The field is 112 miles (180 km) off Norway's coast, with the platform drawing first oil in December 2016. In January 2019 - after operating identical offshore and onshore platform control rooms - the company started conducting remote condition monitoring of platform machinery exclusively from its control room onshore in Trondheim, Norway, 620 miles (1,000 km) away. With the remote equipment condition monitoring done onshore, the operator is better able to optimize maintenance work and schedules. At the same time, it has contributed to a big reduction in the number of offshore personnel otherwise required, reducing operating costs and personnel risks substantially. In May 2018, Siemens entered into a long-term partnership with the operator to continue developing digital solutions in a closed-loop lifecycle approach, utilizing the digital twin concept from pre-FEED and FEED stages through construction, commissioning, and operations, with operations expected to continue for a minimum of 20-years. This paper will provide an update to a 2018 OTC conference presentation when this use case was introduced. Last year's paper was based on operations and observations during 2017, the platform's first full year of operation. © 2019, Offshore Technology Conference},

In drilling applications, Virtual Reality is typically dedicated to rig crew training on physical Drilling Simulators[5] and to maintenance preparation and support. Recently drilling department interest is focusing on the capacity to simulate well response in specific drilling situation and events, in order to support operation follow-up, planning and preparation. Eni, starting from a consolidated development of a virtual drilling environment for training immersion with impact on: rig & equipment knowledge, operation know-how/preparation/planning and safety awareness, has also begun the qualification of a new system for well full digital twin reproduction. In collaboration with Saipem a last generation semi-sub rig for deep water drilling operation was initially fully virtualized, integrating four main modules: walk-through rig and equipment, operation play back, safety interaction and well simulation. The System includes a field database of 300 drilled wells, the extension to a number of drilling rigs and is now easily accessible on PC, in dedicated 3D-rooms and by suitable virtual reality headsets for immersive experience in collaborative environment. As a second step, the qualification of a full digital twin system was started in order to include interaction of the well simulator with well advisory systems and drilling automation developments. This paper gives a description of both the new training goals and the integration of the new system in the well design and operation follow-up process. © 2019 Offshore Mediterranean Conference (OMC).

The infrastructure operators would prefer to have more frequent, on-demand field visits and base the assessments on an up-to-date high resolution, precise asset model. Unfortunately, this has historically not been technically feasible. The underwater inspection vehicles moved relatively slow, the positioning accuracy was limited, and the underwater sensors' accuracy and resolution was not comparable with those used in air. This is not the case anymore. We now operate inspection vehicles traveling with speeds over six knots! We can control them remotely from the office-based command center. Next to the acoustic technology, the vehicles are additionally equipped with optic sensors, dynamically collecting point clouds, images and videos of unprecedented resolution. Gigabytes of data hits the vessel every few minutes. And that's where it used to end… Processing and, so called, "Digital Twin" modelling from this data has traditionally been taking weeks for every day of inspection. In many cases it was simply not technically possible since the data files were prohibitively big. Data required subsampling, more data processors had to go offshore, asset operators had to wait longer. Given the increasing capacity of satellite links, limitless potential of commoditized cloud computing and sophisticated Deep Learning algorithms, we are now able to move subsea asset management to the new era. Through one of their latest research & development programmes - Roames, Fugro has been able to revolutionize the traditional workflows using the state-of-the-art digital technology. The resultant product is a bespoke, web-based service that enables asset (initially pipelines) inspection data to be uploaded to the secure cloud environment, processed using Machine Learning, verified by experts on shore and visualized in an intuitive 4D web viewer. All delivered to the geographically spread stakeholders, operators and decision makers in near real time. This approach greatly reduces the cost of infrastructure management practices, lowers the risk exposure and contributes to extended life of the asset. The Roames, Machine Learning based methodology was validated using a vast archive of survey data prior to testing the workflow on a live project.

	abstract = {This paper investigates - based on model tests and potential flow calculations - several phenomena associated with the green water problem in severe sea states. The topics investigated are: the wave characteristics of the severe and steep sea states, the behavior of the vessel in these waves, the relative motions at the bow and the height of water on deck. The green water problem is of interest since many floaters used for the oil and gas production by the offshore industry are permanently moored for typically 20 years or more, and they will experience severe storm conditions with large wave heights. The investigations concern an unusual vessel type: SBM's innovative midscale Twin-Hull FLNG concept[1]. The floater concept is to join two (standard) LNG carriers together to obtain sufficient storage volume and process deck space. The concept is under development and one aspect, from operability point of view, is the probability for green water. For this purpose a first model test campaign has been carried out. The Twin-Hull FLNG concept has been tested in extreme sea states which are typical for offshore Brazil and East-Africa. Linear potential flow calculations were applied to predict the freeboard exceedance based on relative motion amplitude operators. The correlation to the measured data is discussed. Although the research is dedicated to the Twin-Hull FLNG vessel, the observed phenomena are considered applicable to any stationary vessel in general. Copyright © 2014 by ASME.},

But two risk-mitigation factors not currently considered are (a) the increased operational visibility; and (b) predictive maintenance made possible by today's advanced asset management technologies. Those technologies include the digital twin, data analytics, and secure Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity. With these technologies, E&P operators can now better quantify the probabilities of untoward events and mitigate their risks, improving their HSE posture, and potentially reducing the cost of their insurance premiums. In fact, one E&P OEM using digitalization to better quantify risks related to project errors and omissions led to a $750,000 premium reduction from its insurer, one of the world's largest insurance companies. © 2019, Offshore Technology Conference},

	abstract = {Objective/Scope: A cloud based platform is being built to create and maintain a machine's digital twin model, based on the as-built information and the operating data fed from the machine control system. By making the cloud based machine services available to most offshore operators, this platform has the potential to help monitor machine conditions and operator performance at a relatively low cost. Method, Procedure, Process: Firstly, the cloud digital twin model serves as a vault to store the up-to-date machine data on the cloud for easy access by various parties from different locations. Secondly, when it is connected with a machine control system through a network gateway, operating data can be fed continuously to the cloud platform, enabling the cloud based analytics to digest and derive insights about the conditions of the machine, the performance and behaviors of operators, and the recommended maintenance schedule. Equipment performance grade is used as indicator of equipment performance. Results, Observations, Conclusions: Many modern machine controllers have built-in database capability and are connected into a network with an internet gateway. This makes them ideal for working with cloud services to improve on remote monitoring, trouble shooting and maintenance scheduling. Two application examples, covering a typical drilling system and a crane, are presented. By publishing the up-to-date machine digital twin data on the cloud, which is to be consumed by any computer with internet connection, this platform could help operators streamline operation and maintenance activities, as well as reducing the costs due to the reduced number of site visits by technicians and the lowered expenses following a more optimized maintenance schedule. Novel/Additive Information: The technologies for this platform are well developed with successful applications in many industries. This cloud platform was initially envisioned to be incorporated in our offshore drilling system and crane offerings to facilitate data sharing and trouble shooting of offshore equipment without sending technicians to site. The same cloud services can be used by operators with equipment from other vendors, with some adjustments on the network interfaces. © 2018, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {Being able to give real time on-board advice, without depending on extensive sets of measured data, is the ultimate goal of the digital twin concept. Ideally, the models used in a digital twin only rely on current in-service data, although they have been built using simulated and possibly some measured data. Working with just the 6-DOF motions of a ship, can the local sea state reliably be estimated using the digital twin concept? Does a general model exist to do so, without the need to measure or simulate the particular ship? In this paper, we discuss how simulations of an advancing ship, subjected to various sea states, can be used to estimate the relative wave direction from in-service motion measurements of the corresponding ship. Various types of neural networks are used and evaluated with simulated data and measured data. In order to study the generalization power of the neural networks, a range of ships has been simulated, with varying lengths, drafts and geometries. Neural networks have been trained on selections of the ships in this extended training set and evaluated on the remaining ships. Results show that the developed neural networks give a remarkable performance in simulation data. Furthermore, generalization over geometry is very good, opening the door to train a general model for estimating sea state characteristics. Using the same model for in-service measurements does not perform well enough yet and further research is required. The paper will include discussion on possible causes for this performance gap and some promising ideas for future work. Copyright © 2019 ASME.},

	abstract = {This study aimed at quantifying the effect of mechanical load on the performance of an 18.7 MW offshore gas turbine engine. The targeted engine is of two-shaft free power turbine configuration that operates as a mechanical driver for a process compressor in the gas compression service. The study is a part of a comprehensive performance health monitoring program to address the diagnostic and prognostic requirements in oil and gas offshore platforms and is motivated by the need to provide in-depth knowledge of the gas turbine engine performance. In this work, only the context of some design point key performance parameters and a limited set of collected operational data from the gas turbine in the real plant are available. Therefore, three major tasks, namely design point calculation, characteristic map tuning and off-design performance adaption, were needed to be performed. In order to check the validity of the proposed model, the obtained simulation results were compared with the operational data. The results indicate the maximum inaccuracy of the proposed model is 3.04 %. Finally, by employing the developed model, the engine capability for power generation when exposed to various load speeds is investigated. The obtained result demonstrates at the maximum gas generator speed, every 3 % decrease in mechanical speed leads to 1 % decline in the gas turbine power output. Moreover, when the gas turbine operates under design power load and mechanical speed is lower than 80 % of design speed, every 1 % decrease in load speed results in 0.2 % loss in thermal efficiency. The established relationship will assist proper assessment of mechanical drive gas turbines for performance health monitoring. © 2017, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},
