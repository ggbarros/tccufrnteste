	abstract = {This paper describes how the application of the long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM RNN) model can support the simulation-based digital twin (Sim.-based DT) of a manufacturing system in predicting the new outcome of production upon a changed parameter in the manufacturing setup. Simulation of the assembly production flow, as the only comprehensive ground-truth of the flow, represents the sequence and multi-factor dependencies of the assembly processes (associated with the spatial and environmental parameters) and renders a realistic realization of the production process. Manufacturing digital twin (DT) has adopted such virtualization capability of the simulation [1] to capture, identify, and analyze the real-time abnormalities during the flow and mitigate the risk alongside the process. But simulation software systems are impotent in handling heavy detailed graphics, inflexible (by hard-coded logic) for optimization scenarios, and unresponsive to real-time changing parameters. This paper proposes a dual-layer LSTM RNN model, backed by three Dense layers, to be trained by the production simulation, so to render the generative pattern of the flow behavior and the predicted production outcome when the determinant parameters are changed in real-life. The final model will be a part of a bigger proposal for a hybrid optimization model, which is under development and not covered by the scope of this paper. However, the stand-alone proposed LSTM RNN model in this paper has capability to enhance the functionality of the Sim.-based DT in response to the real-time variations in determinant parameters. With the use of data from offshore wind turbine (OWT) generator's production line in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE) Nacelle factory in Denmark and the corresponding simulation, a pilot model has managed to predict the total number of operators and their allocation to the workstations when a tact time is changed. This study denotes the logic behind the concept, methodologies, and frameworks, which are reusable in any typical manufacturing system supported by simulation. The result of the training evaluation is an affirmative proof of concept for the hypothesis, although, to utilize the trained model in SGRE's real life, there are still some hurdles to overcome. The paper concludes with highlights of difficulties, risks, and limitations of the model helping other industries to predict potential challenges and realistically estimate the required budget for such implementation. © 2024 IEEE.},

Therefore, offshore wind power increasingly needs to reduce the overall operation and maintenance costs and improve the operation and control level of individual turbines and wind farms. Digital twin technology is intelligent, efficient and visual, and can provide intelligent services such as data analysis, fault diagnosis, performance evaluation and optimization suggestions for offshore wind power operation and maintenance. Relying on the digital twin five-dimensional model and its based prognostics health management method, a set of offshore wind power digital twin modeling system is deployed through the construction of data governance and maintenance fault recognition process. The system realizes the operation analysis and optimization of wind turbines, as well as the diagnosis and early warning of key equipment and field groups of wind turbines, which improves the management and control level of offshore wind power, improves the quality of operation and maintenance, optimizes the arrangement of offshore tasks, and reduces the cost of operation and maintenance.

	abstract = {In this work, we implement, verify, and validate a physics-based digital twin solution applied to a floating offshore wind turbine. The digital twin is validated using measurement data from the full-scale TetraSpar prototype. We focus on the estimation of the aerodynamic loads, wind speed, and section loads along the tower, with the aim of estimating the fatigue lifetime of the tower. Our digital twin solution integrates (1) a Kalman filter to estimate the structural states based on a linear model of the structure and measurements from the turbine, (2) an aerodynamic estimator, and (3) a physics-based virtual sensing procedure to obtain the loads along the tower. The digital twin relies on a set of measurements that are expected to be available on any existing wind turbine (power, pitch, rotor speed, and tower acceleration) and motion sensors that are likely to be standard measurements for a floating platform (inclinometers and GPS sensors). We explore two different pathways to obtain physics-based models: A suite of dedicated Python tools implemented as part of this work and the OpenFAST linearization feature. In our final version of the digital twin, we use components from both approaches. We perform different numerical experiments to verify the individual models of the digital twin. In this simulation realm, we obtain estimated damage equivalent loads of the tower fore-Aft bending moment with an accuracy of approximately 5% to 10%. When comparing the digital twin estimations with the measurements from the TetraSpar prototype, the errors increased to 10%-15% on average. Overall, the accuracy of the results is promising and demonstrates the possibility of using digital twin solutions to estimate fatigue loads on floating offshore wind turbines. A natural continuation of this work would be to implement the monitoring and diagnostics aspect of the digital twin to inform operation and maintenance decisions. The digital twin solution is provided with examples as part of an open-source repository. © 2024 Copernicus GmbH. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The global installed capacity of floating offshore wind turbines is projected to increase by at least 100 times over the next decades. Station-keeping of floating offshore renewable energy devices is achieved through the use of mooring systems. Mooring systems are exposed to a variety of environmental and operational conditions that cause corrosion, abrasion, and fatigue. Regular physical in-service inspections of mooring systems are the golden standard for monitoring their health status. This approach is often expensive, inefficient, and unsafe, and for this reason, researchers are focusing on developing tools for digital solutions for real-time monitoring. Floating offshore renewable energy devices are usually equipped with a wide range of sensors, some low-cost, low/zero maintenance, and easily deployable (e.g., accelerometers on the tower), contrary to others (e.g., direct tension mooring line measurements), producing real-time data streams. In this paper, we propose exploiting the data coming from the first type of sensors for mooring systems health status nowcasting. In particular, we will first rely on state-of-the-art supervised shallow and deep learning models for predicting the health status of the different sections of the mooring lines. Then, since these supervised models require types and amount of data that are seldom available, we will propose new shallow and deep weekly supervised models that require a very small amount of data regarding worn mooring lines. Results will show that these last models can potentially have practical applicability and impact for real-time monitoring of mooring systems in the near future. In order to support our statements, we will make use of data generated with a state-of-the-art digital twin of the mooring system, OrcaFlex, for a floating offshore wind turbine reproducing the physical mechanism of the mooring degradation under different loads and environmental conditions. Results will show errors around 1% in the simplest scenario and errors around 4% in the most challenging one, confirming the potentiality of the proposed approaches. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Damage identification techniques are used to assess the structural condition and further ensure structural safety and reliability. The proposed approach for damage identification is based on integrating parameterized physics-based models with multiple datasets collected under various operational and environmental conditions. Damage is identified by tracing the changes in the structural model parameters. Due to model and measurement errors, uncertainties inevitably exist during the process of identifying structural damage. Model error can cause variabilities in the identified condition of the structure when multiple datasets are processed, persisting even under the same operational and environmental conditions. Such variabilities undermine the effectiveness of damage identification techniques, often leading to inaccurate results or false alarms. To this end, this work presents a hierarchical Bayesian learning framework for identifying the location and size of structural damage in the presence of variabilities arising from model error. It is assumed that a sufficiently large number of datasets is collected from the structure at its healthy and its damage condition. A physicsbased digital twin is learned and a probabilistic model for the damage index is introduced based on posterior distribution of the model parameters, accounting for the aforementioned variabilities. The estimation is based on sampling algorithms as well as computationally efficient asymptotic approximation tools introduced to considerably improve the computational burden of the proposed framework. The performance of the framework is illustrated using multiple data sets collected from the healthy and damage states of an example dynamical structure. Results indicate that the proposed framework provide robustness of structural damage identification to uncertainties. The framework has great potential to be applied to various infrastructure components, including bridges, buildings, offshore structures and wind turbines. © 2022 ISRERM Organizers.

	abstract = {Purpose: The paper aims to analyze the structural integrity of an existing offshore platform located in the Northern Adriatic Sea, followed by the topside decommissioning and the re-utilization of the jacket as a wind turbine support. The structural integrity assessment against the in-place and the long-term actions is accomplished by using a reduced basis finite element method (RB-FEA) software program assessing the capability of the jacket to be used as a support for wind turbines at the end of its life cycle as oil and gas (O&G) platform. Design/methodology/approach: The project starts by modeling the jacket, and subsequently, the structural analyses for the in-place loads in operative and extreme conditions are performed. Then, the fatigue analysis is carried out in order to define the cumulative damage necessary to evaluate the possibility to use the jacket as a wind turbine support. Findings: The results show that the jacket, at the end of the service life as O&G platform, is able to withstand the loads produced by the installation of the wind turbine since the analyses are satisfied even with the conservative approach used which overestimates the thickness loss assuming a linear increasing value during the service life. Research limitations/implications: Because of the chosen approach, the study presents some limitations, especially concerning the real state of the platform which has been defined considering the thickness loss only. Additionally, a 1D model was used to perform the analyses, and hence, a 3D model could help in evaluating the critical points with higher precision. Practical implications: The assessment of the structure could be improved by modeling a digital twin of the asset allowing a real-time monitoring which, however, involves a huge amount of data to be processed, so a suitable simulation technology must be used. Originality/value: The RB-FEA proposed by Akselos is suitable to perform the analyses speeding up the processing of the data even in real time. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Dynamic power cable acts as both electricity current channel and information channel between offshore floating wind turbine and substation. Key role as it plays, the mechanical behaviors of dynamic power cable in operation is complicated, owing to the multiple internal loads involved in the cross section and the drastic stress distribution along the cable. In this paper, a multi-task integrated model based on LSTM is proposed to realize both the tension and the bending moment prediction at several fatigue-prone locations. Regarding the parameter combination in high dimension and time-consuming search for the optimum, halving grid search algorithm is applied to conduct hyper-parameters optimization with higher efficiency over wider range. Additionally, due to the motion effects brought by the buoyancy section, the prediction accuracy of the model at locations other than the hang-off point is lower, which is resolved by introducing an subsea sensor at the hog bend to provide additional 3-DOF motion inputs. The improvement brought by the additional inputs at the other points than the hang-off point can be up to 10%. The reliability of the multi-task integrated model is evaluated in a stochastic irregular wave generated by a different random seed as well as wave parameters scaled at different ratios, and a satisfying consistency is observed. Furthermore, the proposed model is applied in extreme sea state, in which the model exhibits comparable performance with its performance in operational sea state. The desirable performance in both the operational and extreme sea states demonstrates the robustness of the model, and implies its potential in more various sea states. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Offshore wind represents a highly efficient, environmentally friendly, and scalable source of power. In the offshore area, wind turbines are usually anchored on the seabed at less than 50 meters depth. However, floating offshore wind technology is anticipated to revolutionize energy production in deeper ocean areas. Within the Black Sea FLoating Offshore Wind (BLOW) project, the main goal is to analyze the efficiency of capturing the wind potential in the Black Sea basin. It aims to achieve this by showcasing an innovative and cost-effective floating unit tailored for low-to medium-wind speed conditions in the Black Sea. The project's pilot initiative seeks to enhance regional energy security while improving the cost-effectiveness of wind energy. This is proposed through the integration of turbines and floats into a semi-submersible structure with a pyramid design. Additionally, the project will feature advanced elements such as an innovative mooring system, subsea monitoring with predictive maintenance, a digital twin for operational optimization, and grid integration control techniques. The BLOW project aims to implement a pilot project involving a 5 MW wind turbine in the Black Sea. The transition to sustainable energy in the region will be accelerated by stimulating synergies with the oil and gas sector, as well as developing cross-border policy. The energy cost price level estimated by BLOW varies between 87 EUR/MWh and 50 EUR/MWh (until 2028 and after 2030). The impact on environmental factors will be reduced by at least 40 % through the innovative construction.  © 2024 IEEE.},
