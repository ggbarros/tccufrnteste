Abstract = {Digital Twins bring several benefits for planning, operation, and
   maintenance of remote offshore assets. In this work, we explain the
   digital twin concept and the capability level scale in the context of
   wind energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate a standalone digital twin, a
   descriptive digital twin, and a prescriptive digital twin of an
   operational floating offshore wind turbine. The standalone digital twin
   consists of the virtual representation of the wind turbine and its
   operating environment. While at this level the digital twin does not
   evolve with the physical turbine, it can be used during the planning-,
   design-, and construction phases. At the next level, the descriptive
   digital twin is built upon the standalone digital twin by enhancing the
   latter with real data from the turbine. All the data is visualized in
   virtual reality for informed decision-making. Besides being used for
   data bundling and visualization, the descriptive digital twin forms the
   basis for diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive, and autonomous tools. A
   predictive digital twin is created through the use of weather forecasts,
   neural networks, and transfer learning. Finally, digital twin technology
   is discussed in a much wider context of ocean engineering.},

Abstract = {This paper delves into the application of digital twin monitoring
   techniques for enhancing offshore floating wind turbine performance,
   with a detailed case study that uses open-source digital twin software.
   We explore the practical implementation of digital twins and their
   efficacy in optimizing operations and predictive maintenance, focusing
   on controlling the real-time structural state of composite wind turbine
   structures and forecasting the remaining useful life by tracking the
   fatigue state in the structure. Our findings emphasize digital twins'
   potential as a valuable tool for renewable energy, driving efficiency
   and sustainability in offshore floating wind installations. These
   aspects, along with the aforementioned simulations, whether in real-time
   or forecasted, reduce costly and unnecessary inspections and scheduled

   proposed mechanics-based digital twin, the alternations in the

   diagnosis purposes. The proposed technology is implemented on a
   numerical torsional model of a wind turbine drivetrain system to update
   the drivetrain model using simulated data and predict the

   approach is used to update the failure models and estimate the remaining

Abstract = {During the recent research studies Digital Twin (DT) simulation models
   for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) based on data-driven mode have
   been developed, which can provide accurate simulation and prediction of
   mooring forces of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWTs). However, the
   performance of this kind modelling is highly affected by the quantity of
   real data training set and it is limited to some specific configuration
   and the recorded environmental conditions. More importantly, the
   data-driven DT cannot interpret the physical meaning of structural
   dynamic interactions.
   Therefore, a new Physics-Based estimator is proposed in this work. The
   fully coupled FOWT simulations are carried out in QBlade Ocean and the
   simulation results are used to prepare the Reduced-Order Model by system
   identification for different sea states. The proposed estimator is based
   on the Augmented Kalman Filter in which the unknown mooring force is
   augmented as a state. The prediction of state is adjusted with the
   measurable platform motion data. It demonstrates the ability of
   filtering the noise in measurements and capturing the dynamic behaviour
   of FOWT with acceptable low computational cost. This real-time state
   estimator also provides the foundation of developing the DT modelling
   framework of FOWT and enables us to scale-up FOWTs in the next stage.},

Title = {Recent progress on reliability analysis of offshore wind turbine support
   structures considering digital twin solutions},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {232},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Global wind energy has developed rapidly in recent years, and the
   offshore wind turbines (OWTs) have been applied to much more
   applications. Because the support structure of an OWT is prone to
   damage, it is crucial to strengthen the structural reliability to
   prevent unexpected failures and reduce operation costs by performing
   fault diagnosis, remaining useful life prediction, and condition-based
   maintenance. Through real-time monitoring on the operating status of the
   OWT support structures, the operation measurements can be obtained to
   detect initial structural cracks and predict the crack propagation to
   assess potential risks and perform just-in-time maintenance; as a
   result, the turbine downtime and maintenance costs can be significantly
   reduced and the wind turbine service life can be prolonged. This paper
   introduces the latest progress on the reliability analysis of the OWT
   support structures. First of all, the types of the support structures
   are reviewed; then, the reliability research progress on the support
   structure is presented and the existing challenges are discussed. In
   light of the digital twin (DT) technology, a solution to existing
   challenging issues is proposed by introducing the DT into the OWT
   support structures. This new DT framework will enable real-time
   monitoring, fault diagnosis and operation optimization of the OWT
   support structures, which may provide a useful application prospect in
   the reliability analysis of the OWT support structures in the future.},

Abstract = {Predicting the output power of wind generators is essential to improve
   grid flexibility, which is vulnerable to power supply variability and
   uncertainty. Digital twins can help predict the output of a wind turbine
   using a variety of environmental data generated by real-world systems.
   This paper dealt with the development of a physics-based output
   prediction model (P-bOPM) for a 10 MW floating offshore wind turbine
   (FOWT) for a digital twin. The wind power generator dealt with in this
   paper was modeled considering the NREL 5 MW standard wind turbine with a
   semi-submersible structure. A P-bOPM of a 10 MW FOWT for a digital twin
   was designed and simulated using ANSYS Twin Builder. By connecting the
   P-bOPM developed for the digital twin implementation with an external
   sensor through TCP/IP communication, it was possible to calculate the
   output of the wind turbine using real-time field data. As a result of
   evaluating the P-bOPM for various marine environments, it showed good
   accuracy. The digital twin equipped with the P-bOPM, which accurately
   reflects the variability of the offshore wind farm and can predict the
   output in real time, will be a great help in improving the flexibility
   of the power system in the future.},

Abstract = {The number of installed Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWTs) has
   doubled since 2017, quadrupling the total installed capacity, and is
   expected to increase significantly over the next decade. Consequently,
   there is a growing consideration towards the main challenges for FOWT
   projects: monitoring the system's integrity, extending the lifespan of
   the components, and maintaining FOWTs safely at scale. Effectively and
   efficiently addressing these challenges would unlock the wide-scale
   deployment of FOWTs. In this work, we focus on one of the most critical
   components of the FOWTs, the Mooring Lines (MoLs), which are responsible
   for fixing the structure to the seabed. The primary mechanical failure
   mechanisms in MoLs are extreme load and fatigue, both of which are
   functions of the axial tension. An effective solution to detect long
   term drifts in the mechanical response of the MoLs is to develop a
   Digital Twin (DT) able to accurately predict the behaviour of the
   healthy system to compare with the actual one. Authors will leverage
   operational data collected from the world's first commercial floating
   wind farm (Hywind Pilot Park(1)) in 2018, to investigate the
   effectiveness of the DT for the prediction of the MoL axial tension. The
   DT will be developed using state-of-the-art data-driven methods, and
   results based on real operational data will support our proposal.},

Abstract = {In the wind energy industry, a digital twin (DT) is very useful for
   managing the operation of a wind turbine and predicting structural
   health conditions in real-time as well as projections in the near
   future. A real-time surrogate model is a very crucial part in building a
   DT. Towards that end, we employ a Reduced-Order Modelling (ROM) approach
   to construct a surrogate model for the environment-structure system of a
   bottom-fixed offshore wind turbine (OWT). The entire
   environment-structure system is broken down into major sub-systems of
   wind, wave, and structure. Based on the high-fidelity Computational
   Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data, the wind ROM model can quickly provide the
   loadings on the components above water level in the parameter space
   spanned by the incoming wind speed, the rotational speed of the rotor,
   the pitch and tilt angles of the turbine. The hydro loadings on the
   underwater components of the OWT are solved by the empirical Morison
   formula. The OWT structural ROM model is component-based consisting of
   blades, hub, nacelle, tower, and monopile. The structural ROM model
   takes the loading data feeds from the wind and wave models to predict
   the structure responses of the OWT system, including stress. Since the
   DT is constructed via the component-based, it can also be used to play
   out ``what if{''} scenarios when there are component level changes. For
   instance, the model can predict the system response of OWT when certain
   parts undergo structure failures. Benefiting from the cost-efficient ROM
   models, the DT is over two orders of magnitude faster than high-fidelity
   simulations while maintaining good accuracy.},

Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Due to the adverse impact of the offshore environment, the cost of
   on-site monitoring, operation and maintenance of offshore wind turbines
   is greatly increased. Here, a digital twin (DT) method based on digital
   model and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation database is
   proposed, which is used to rapidly predict and synchronously display the
   distribution of the wake field, structural deformation and stress of
   fixed OWTs. First, a large number of data have been calculated by using
   CFD method. Second, the three-dimensional finite element model is
   reduced to a digital model by the proper orthogonal decomposition
   method, all data is stored in a multisource heterogeneous database.
   Furthermore, the anisotropic inverse distance weighted interpolation and
   particle swarm optimization algorithm methods are used to obtain
   uncalculated data results and supplement database. Then the Bayesian
   regularization-back propagation neural network method is developed to
   correct the data with large errors. The results show that the learning
   error of the flow field and structural strength is less than 10\% and
   4\% compared with the CFD method, respectively. This study could provide
   a rapid monitoring engineering reference for the safety assessment of
   turbine flow field distribution and structural strength.},

   Twin Technology: A Comprehensive Review},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This comprehensive review explores the application and impact of digital
   twin (DT) technology in bolstering the reliability of Floating Offshore
   Wind Turbines (FOWTs) and their supporting platforms. Within the
   burgeoning domain of offshore wind energy, this study contextualises the
   need for heightened reliability measures in FOWTs and elucidates how DT
   technology serves as a transformative tool to address these concerns.
   Analysing the existing scholarly literature, the review encompasses
   insights into the historical reliability landscape, DT deployment
   methodologies, and their influence on FOWT structures. Findings
   underscore the pivotal role of DT technology in enhancing FOWT
   reliability through real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance
   strategies, resulting in improved operational efficiency and reduced
   downtime. Highlighting the significance of DT technology as a potent
   mechanism for fortifying FOWT reliability, the review emphasises its
   potential to foster a robust operational framework while acknowledging
   the necessity for continued research to address technical intricacies
   and regulatory considerations in its integration within offshore wind
   energy systems. Challenges and opportunities related to the integration
   of DT technology in FOWTs are thoroughly analysed, providing valuable
   insights into the role of DTs in optimising FOWT reliability and
   performance, thereby offering a foundation for future research and

Title = {Reliability Updating of Offshore Wind Substructures by Use of Digital
   Twin Information},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper presents a probabilistic framework for updating the
   structural reliability of offshore wind turbine substructures based on
   digital twin information. In particular, the information obtained from
   digital twins is used to quantify and update the uncertainties
   associated with the structural dynamics and load modeling parameters in
   fatigue damage accumulation. The updated uncertainties are included in a
   probabilistic model for fatigue damage accumulation used to update the
   structural reliability. The updated reliability can be used as input to
   optimize decision models for operation and maintenance of existing
   structures and design of new structures. The framework is exemplified
   based on two numerical case studies with a representative offshore wind
   turbine and information acquired from previously established digital
   twins. In this context, the effect of updating soil stiffness and wave
   loading, which constitute two highly uncertain and sensitive parameters,
   is investigated. It is found that updating the soil stiffness
   significantly affects the reliability of the joints close to the
   mudline, while updating the wave loading significantly affects the
   reliability of the joints localized in the splash zone. The increased
   uncertainty related to virtual sensing, which is employed to update wave
   loading, reduces structural reliability.},

Abstract = {Digital tools such as machine learning and the digital twins are
   emerging in asset management of offshore wind structures to address
   their structural integrity and cost challenges due to manual inspections

   digital twins incorporating finite element analysis, material
   characterisation and modelling, machine learning using artificial neural

Abstract = {Operations and installation on offshore wind and especially floating are
   complex and difficult actions due to site accessibility and equipment
   availability. In this regard, digitalization is disrupting the wind
   section thanks to the development of advanced sensors, automated
   equipment, computational power, among other. All these allow to optimize
   and simplify different parts of the offshore wind power plant
   development (i.e. design, planning, installation, O \& M, etc.). This
   fact is of special interest on maintenance, since the early detection of
   failures or malfunctions lead to reduced costly corrective maintenance.
   This paper presents a literature review of current state-of-the-art on
   the application of digitalization activities which can be applied for
   floating wind, including typical component failures, monitoring
   techniques and advanced digital tools as Digital Twin concept and
   Building Information Models (BIM). Finally, the review paper provides an
   analysis of existing gaps, needs and challenges of the sector to provide
   guides on research and innovation to foster offshore wind sector. (C)\&

Title = {Joint parameter-input estimation for digital twinning of the Block
   Island wind turbine using output-only measurements},
Journal = {MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {198},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {This paper presents a recursive Bayesian inference framework for digital
   twinning of an offshore wind turbine (OWT) in the Block Island Wind Farm
   (BIWF), the first commercial offshore wind farm in the U.S. with jacket
   substructure. The framework employs a window-based extended Kalman
   filter (EKF) to jointly estimate the dynamic input loads and unknown
   model parameters of the finite element (FE) model of the turbine using
   sparse output-only measurements. The estimation of input loads on the
   OWT is critical for fatigue life estimation, foundation monitoring and
   control strategy. In the proposed joint estimation algorithm, unknown
   input time histories are divided into overlapping windows and the
   current window of inputs is concatenated with uncertain model parameters
   to form an augmented state vector. To account for the uncertainty about
   wind direction and misalignment between wind direction and the turbine
   yaw angle, two independent horizontal wind load time histories in X and
   Y directions are estimated at the nacelle level. A numerical validation
   study is first performed in which wind loads of the OWT are simulated
   using the multi-physics platform FAST, and structural vibration
   responses are generated using the FE model in OpenSees. The window-based
   EKF is implemented using the simulated measurements, and the estimations
   of structural stiffness as the updating model parameter and input loads
   are observed to have high accuracy. The proposed algorithm is then
   validated using in-situ measurements on one of the OWT in BIWF. To
   investigate the effectiveness and robustness of the method under
   different environmental and operational conditions, four cases are
   considered in which the turbine is operating at the rated rotor speed
   (region 3 of power generation), below the rated rotor speed (region 2),
   idling rotor state (region 1 or no power), and region 4 beyond cut-out
   wind speed. Accurate predictions of acceleration and strain data are
   obtained using the proposed algorithm, and the estimations of model
   parameter are consistent and close to their nominal value under
   different conditions. These results from numerical and experimental
   studies validate the proposed window-based EKF for joint parameter-input
   estimation and digital twinning for long-term structural health
   monitoring of the OWT.},

Title = {Requirements for the application of the Digital Twin Paradigm to
   offshore wind turbine structures for uncertain fatigue analysis},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {145},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Digital Twin (DT) paradigm offers an extension of simulation model
   utility into the operational phase of an engineering asset. The goal is
   a simulation ``twinned{''}with observed data that reflects the actual
   performance of the asset. However, exploring sources of uncertainty for
   both the physical asset and the simulation model are a challenge. For
   example, random metocean conditions, and uncertainty on model parameters
   and response behaviour of offshore wind turbine (OWT) structures,
   contribute to uncertainty for predicted life under fatigue. In-service
   assessment of OWT structures will benefit from twinning simulations and
   observed data, where a framework to treat this uncertainty is defined.
   The DT needs to capture state, condition, and behaviour to a level that
   allows quantification and propagation of uncertainty for reliability
   analysis. Using a DT, built for fatigue assessment of bolted
   ring-flanges on OWT support structures, this paper explores the
   challenges and opportunities in defining uncertainties of interest. We
   propagate these uncertainties through the DT in a coherent manner using
   a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate modelling approach, efficiently
   emulating a computationally expensive numerical simulator. The GP is an
   attractive surrogate model method given this computational efficiency,
   in addition to providing an estimate of prediction uncertainty at
   unobserved points in the output space. The use of the GP surrogate model
   is included within a definition of the Surrogate DT, a framework
   including ``fast{''}and ``slow{''}twinning processes. We define six
   requirements to apply DTs to OWT structures which provide practical
   guidelines for modelling this complex asset under uncertainty.},

Abstract = {A response-based time domain structural analysis method for offshore
   floating platforms has been studied and validated. Compared to the
   conventional load-based and simplified method, the response base method
   can evaluate structural strength and fatigue damage with higher
   accuracy, taking into account irregular waves, non-linear environmental
   loadings, phasing between different loads, non-linear motion responses,
   and non-linear mooring and riser loadings.
   The present study examines the structural assessment of the entire
   substructure and the turbine tower to substructure connection of a
   Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT) platform using a response-based
   time domain structural analysis. Finite Element (FE) models are
   constructed for the entire FOWT, and corresponding load components are
   mapped to the FE model. A fully coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic
   analysis software, MLTSIM-OpenFAST, is used to calculate dynamic
   responses of a FOWT in the time domain. and used for the life cycle
   response analysis of a FOWT with 25 years of weather data.
   All load components are synthesized at every instantaneous time step and
   converted to response-based stresses. This methodology efficiently and
   more accurately determines the stress distribution for different load
   cases which is useful for both new design and digital twin for integrity
   management to provide quick structural strength and fatigue damage
   assessment.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to optimize wind farm layout during
   operation based on digital twin and dynamic repositioning. The
   technology offers a possibility to increase the total energy production
   of floating wind farms by minimizing the wake effect. We assume each of
   the individual wind turbine is completed with a propulsion system and is
   allowed to reposition itself anywhere in the restricted domain. The
   simulations are performed in a digital twin platform based on Unity 3D,
   where wind speed and direction are used as inputs for the digital twin.
   Furthermore, Jensen's wake model is implemented to model the dynamic
   behaviour of the wind. To find an optimal position for all individual
   wind turbines, two methods are proposed. The first method is based on
   reactive control, while the second method is based on optimal control.
   The possible energy gains of dynamic repositioning with real-life
   scenarios are assessed to show the feasibility of the proposed method.

Title = {Digital twins of the mooring line tension for floating offshore wind
   turbines to improve monitoring, lifespan, and safety},

Abstract = {The number of installed floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) has
   doubled since 2017, quadrupling the total installed capacity, and is
   expected to increase significantly over the next decade. Consequently,
   there is a growing consideration towards the main challenges for FOWT
   projects: monitoring the system's integrity, extending the lifespan of
   the components, and maintaining FOWTs safely at scale. Effectively and
   efficiently addressing these challenges would unlock the wide-scale
   deployment of FOWTs. In this work, we focus on one of the most critical
   components of the FOWTs, the Mooring Lines (MoLs), which are responsible
   for fixing the structure to the seabed. The primary mechanical failure
   mechanisms in MoLs are extreme load and fatigue, both of which are
   functions of the axial tension. An effective solution to detect
   long-term drifts in the mechanical response of the MoLs is to develop a
   Digital Twin (DT) able to accurately predict the behaviour of the
   healthy system to compare with the actual one. Moreover, we will develop
   another DT able to accurately predict the near future axial tension as
   an effective tool to improve the lifespan of the MoLs and the safety of
   FOWT maintenance operations. In fact, by changing the FOWT operational
   settings, according to the DT prediction, operators can increase the
   lifespan of the MoLs by reducing the stress and, additionally, in the
   case where FOWT operational maintenance is in progress, the prediction
   from the DT can serve as early safety warning to operators. Authors will
   leverage operational data collected from the world's first commercial
   floating-wind farm {[}the Hywind Pilot Park
   (https://www.equinor.com/en/what-we-do/floating-wind/hywind-scotland.htm
   l.)] in 2018, to investigate the effectiveness of DTs for the prediction
   of the MoL axial tension for the two scenarios depicted above. The DTs
   will be developed using state-of-the-art data-driven methods, and
   results based on real operational data will support our proposal.},

Abstract = {To achieve higher efficiency and reduce the wind energy cost, the size
   of wind turbines is getting bigger and offshore wind is getting more
   attraction. Therefore, the Operation \& Maintenance of a single wind
   turbine and a large-scale wind farm are becoming more important. This
   paper presents the implementation of digital twin-assisted condition
   monitoring and fault diagnosis for wind turbines. Based on a 5-dimension
   modeling approach, we design and implement a digital twin for a 2 MW
   class double-fed induction generator-based wind turbine system. Then, we
   suggest an algorithm based on the digital twin framework to virtually
   monitor wind turbine conditions and form an initial fault detection
   algorithm. The digital twin shows high accuracy and the digital
   twin-based diagnosis algorithm shows a high performance.},

Title = {A digital twin solution for floating offshore wind turbines validated
   using a full-scale prototype},
Journal = {WIND ENERGY SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-24},

Abstract = {In this work, we implement, verify, and validate a physics-based digital
   twin solution applied to a floating offshore wind turbine. The digital
   twin is validated using measurement data from the full-scale TetraSpar
   prototype. We focus on the estimation of the aerodynamic loads, wind
   speed, and section loads along the tower, with the aim of estimating the
   fatigue lifetime of the tower. Our digital twin solution integrates (1)
   a Kalman filter to estimate the structural states based on a linear
   model of the structure and measurements from the turbine, (2) an
   aerodynamic estimator, and (3) a physics-based virtual sensing procedure
   to obtain the loads along the tower. The digital twin relies on a set of
   measurements that are expected to be available on any existing wind
   turbine (power, pitch, rotor speed, and tower acceleration) and motion
   sensors that are likely to be standard measurements for a floating
   platform (inclinometers and GPS sensors). We explore two different
   pathways to obtain physics-based models: a suite of dedicated Python
   tools implemented as part of this work and the OpenFAST linearization
   feature. In our final version of the digital twin, we use components
   from both approaches. We perform different numerical experiments to
   verify the individual models of the digital twin. In this simulation
   realm, we obtain estimated damage equivalent loads of the tower fore-aft
   bending moment with an accuracy of approximately 5 \% to 10 \%. When
   comparing the digital twin estimations with the measurements from the
   TetraSpar prototype, the errors increased to 10 \%-15 \% on average.
   Overall, the accuracy of the results is promising and demonstrates the
   possibility of using digital twin solutions to estimate fatigue loads on
   floating offshore wind turbines. A natural continuation of this work
   would be to implement the monitoring and diagnostics aspect of the
   digital twin to inform operation and maintenance decisions. The digital
   twin solution is provided with examples as part of an open-source
   repository.},

Abstract = {Efficient operation of mooring systems is of paramount importance to
   reduce floating offshore wind (FOW) energy costs. MooringSense is an
   R\&D project which explores digitization to enable the implementation of
   more efficient integrity management sfrategies (IMS) for FOW mooring
   systems. In this work, the MooringSense concept is presented. It
   includes the development of several enablers such as a mooring system
   digital twin, a smart motion sensor, a structural health monitoring
   (SHM) system and control sfrategies at the individual turbine and farm
   levels. The core of the digital twin (DT) is a high-fidelity fully
   coupled numerical model which integrates simulation tools to allow
   predictive operation and maintenance (O\&M). Relevant parameters of the
   coupled model are updated as physical properties evolve due to damages
   or degradation. The DT assimilates information coming from the physical
   asset and environmental sensors. Besides, a smart motion sensor provides
   feedback of the attitude, position, and velocity of the floater to allow
   the computation of virtual loads in the mooring lines, the detection of
   damages by the SHM system and the implementation of closed-loop control
   sfrategies. Finally, the IMS takes advantage of the mooring system
   updated condition information to optimize O\&M, reduce costs and
   increase energy production.},

Abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of the tower and foundation
   structures of offshore wind turbines is an established and acknowledged
   technical rule in engineering practice. The acquisition, assessment and
   analysis of the acting fatigue loads is an essential aspect in this
   field of SHM, since it enables the optimization of turbine operation
   towards lower fatigue lifetime consumption and provides potential for
   the extension of service life. Fatigue loads can either be measured
   directly using strain gauges or indirectly reconstructed from the
   measurement of tower deformations in conjunction with a mechanical
   model, e. g. a finite element (FE) model. The indirect reconstruction
   can also be described by the notions of ``virtual sensors{''} or
   ``digital twin{''} The current report presents how fatigue loads on
   relevant areas of offshore foundation structures, such as the
   tower-transition piece interface, can be reconstructed from acceleration
   and inclination measurements. The approach uses the structural responses
   recorded at the tower and an FE model to determine internal forces or
   moments in the structure. Using real examples from German offshore wind
   farms, the effect of the available measurement information and
   considered load assumptions on the estimation accuracy is shown. The
   effects of uncertainties from acquisition and model assumptions (e. g.
   calibration errors and soil stiffness) are also presented.},

Title = {A digital twin-based framework for simulation and monitoring analysis of
   floating wind turbine structures},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {283},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {It is currently a prevailing trend to adopt clean energies instead of
   traditional ones due to the global climate change caused by carbon
   emissions. Offshore wind farms, in particular, have emerged as a crucial
   source of renewable energy, owing to their benefits such as no land
   occupation and abundant resources. However, the design, installation,
   operation, and maintenance (O \& M) of floating wind turbines (FWTs)
   involve multiple sources of heterogeneous data, which pose challenges to
   data integration and management, as well as to the simulation and
   analysis of FWTs. To address this issue, this study proposes a unified
   framework based on digital twin (DT) to acquire and integrate diverse
   types of information used throughout the entire life cycle of FWTs. A
   digital 3D model serves as a medium to enable real-time synchronization
   and inversion of sensor data, facilitating the simulation and analysis
   of the global state of FWTs. The proposed framework is evaluated through
   a case study of a twin-barge float-over project, which includes process
   simulation, mechanical analysis, and anomaly identification. The results
   demonstrate that DT can facilitate timely monitoring and analysis of
   FWTs, and enable visualization of construction plans, early warning of
   structural abnormalities, and accurate recognition of FWT posture and
   marine environment. The case study validates the efficacy of the
   proposed framework in ensuring personnel and equipment safety,
   optimizing project plans, and improving construction efficiency.},

Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},

Abstract = {In the wind energy industry, a cost-benefit digital twin (DT) will be
   very useful for managing the operation of a wind turbine. For instance,
   a DT could provide information on structural health conditions in
   real-time as well as projections for the near future. In this work, we
   employ a component-based Reduced-Order Modelling (ROM) technique to
   construct a DT of a parameter-varying offshore wind turbine system on a
   monopile. The DT consists of a ROM model for modal analysis and
   structural response prediction under wind and wave loadings. First, an
   offline library is pre-computed, which contains a series of component
   archetypes. Then, the component-based ROM is assembled out of these
   archetypes, such as the parts in the blade, hub, nacelle, and tower.
   With the computation speed of two orders (approximately 650x) faster
   than a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model and high accuracy (less than
   0.2\% error), the DT could be able to provide almost instant predictions
   of the modes and the responses of the turbine structure due to the
   wind-wave loading as well as projections of structural health
   conditions.},

Abstract = {As the Floating Offshore Wind Turbine industry approaches the transition
   from demonstrators to commercial scale farms, condition monitoring
   systems will be integral to risk management. Scalable condition
   monitoring solutions exist for both Fixed Offshore Wind and floating Oil
   and Gas, however a holistic solution addressing aerodynamic and
   hydrodynamic challenges on a floating wind unit is lacking.
   Where sensors should be minimized, or for unmeasurable parameters,
   digital twins offer an alternative for predicting major component
   condition, relying instead on numerical models based on floater global
   response and metocean conditions.
   This paper demonstrates the potential of reconstructed load signals,
   state-of-the-art sensors and first principles physics-based digital
   twins using approaches from the Wind and Oil and Gas sectors. Existing
   motion-based integrity monitoring methods are adapted to a real-time
   reduced-order model of a floating wind unit. Specifically, a
   state-observer model is used to reproduce position and mooring tension,
   enabling mooring failure identification and fatigue tracking.
   The methods are demonstrated through a 15 MW synthetic case study,
   including examination of the impact of noise and sensor loss on
   reliability. The results show that the integration of digital twins into
   sensor-based monitoring systems can reconstruct missing data with
   sufficient certainty to facilitate early detection of failures.},

Title = {A Comparative Analysis of the Characteristics of Platform Motion of a
   Floating Offshore Wind Turbine Based on Pitch Controllers},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The installation of fixed offshore wind power systems at greater water
   depths requires a floating body at the foundation of the system.
   However, this presents various issues. This study analyzes the
   characteristics of the platform motion of a floating offshore wind
   turbine system based on the performance of the pitch controller. The
   motion characteristics of the platform in a floating offshore wind power
   generation system, change according to the response speed of the blade
   pitch controller since the wind turbine is installed on a floating
   platform unlike the existing onshore wind power generation system.
   Therefore, this study analyzes the platform motion characteristics of a
   floating offshore wind turbine system using various pitch controllers
   that have been applied in previous studies. Consequently, an appropriate
   pitch controller is proposed for the floating offshore wind turbine
   system. The floating offshore wind turbine system developed in this
   study consists of an NREL 5-MW class wind turbine and an OC4
   semi-submersible floating platform; the pitch controller is evaluated
   using FAST-v8 developed by NREL. The results of this study demonstrate
   that the pitch controller reduces the platform motion of the floating
   offshore wind power generation system, considering both the individual
   pitch control and the negative damping phenomenon. Additionally, it is
   confirmed that the output increases by approximately 0.42\%, while the
   output variability decreases by 19.3\% through the reduction of the
   platform movement.},

Title = {Digital twin of wind farms via physics-informed deep learning},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {293},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The spatiotemporal flow field in a wind farm determines the wind
   turbines' energy production and structural fatigue. However, it is not
   obtainable by the current measurement, modeling, and prediction tools in
   wind industry. Here we propose a novel data and knowledge fusion
   approach to create the first digital twin for onshore/offshore wind farm
   flow system, which can predict the in situ spatiotemporal wind field
   covering the entire wind farm. The digital twin is developed by
   integrating the Lidar measurements, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the
   turbine modeling using actuator disk method, via physics-informed neural
   networks. The design enables the seamless integration of Lidar
   measurements and turbine operating data for real-time flow
   characterization, and the fusion of flow physics for retrieving
   unmeasured wind field information. It thus addresses the limitations of
   existing wind prediction approaches based on supervised machine
   learning, which cannot achieve such prediction because the training
   targets are not available. Case studies of a wind farm under typical
   operating scenarios (i.e. a greedy case, a wake-steering case, and a
   partially-operating case) are carried out using high-fidelity numerical
   experiments, and the results show that the developed digital twin
   achieves very accurate mirroring of the physical wind farm, capturing
   detailed flow features such as wake interaction and wake meandering. The
   prediction error for the flow fields, on average, is just 4.7\% of the
   value range. With the accurate flow field information predicted, the
   digital twin is expected to enable brand new research across wind farm
   lifecycle including monitoring, control, and load assessment.},

Title = {Using Bayesian updating for monopile offshore wind turbines monitoring},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {280},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Digital twins (DTs) are thought to be promising tools for offshore wind
   turbines (OWTs) in real-time updating, optimized design, intelligent
   operation, and maintenance. When creating DT analysis tools, it is
   critical to update model parameters to create high-fidelity,
   high-accuracy virtual models. In this paper, a Bayesian updating
   framework based on Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC) is
   proposed to construct the desired virtual model of monopile OWTs to
   address this difficult problem. The likelihood function for Bayesian
   inference was created using measurements from physical entity monitoring
   as well as natural frequencies and damping ratios from the monopile OWT
   finite element (FE) model. Then, through a series of relatively simple
   intermediate likelihood functions, it gradually converges to the target
   function. During this time, the artificial neural network (ANN)
   surrogate model calculates the intermediate likelihood function of each
   sample, and a parallel computing strategy is used to enhance the
   computational efficiency. The results show that the posterior
   distribution of the uncertain parameters can be successfully estimated
   from the Markov chain using this method to update the finite element
   model. In addition, the proposed Bayesian updating method is resistant
   to measurement noise.},

Title = {Mechanics-based model updating for identification and virtual sensing of
   an offshore wind turbine using sparse measurements},
Journal = {STRUCTURAL CONTROL \& HEALTH MONITORING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Offshore wind turbines are complex systems operating in harsh
   environment. The dynamic demands in these systems often differ from
   values used in design, leading to unexpected mechanical and structural
   failures. This signifies the importance of remote monitoring
   technologies for damage diagnosis and prognosis in offshore wind
   turbines. This study is focused on developing mechanics-based digital
   twins for offshore wind turbine monitoring through a model-updating
   process using sparse measurement data. Digital twins can be used to
   estimate the system unmeasured response (i.e., virtual sensing) and to
   predict the remaining useful fatigue life and failure point of different
   structural components. A time-domain sequential Bayesian finite element
   model updating is proposed for mechanics-based digital twinning. This
   approach is formulated for application to offshore wind turbine and
   jointly estimates the updating model parameters and the time history of
   unknown input forces. A classical modal-based model updating followed by
   modal expansion method is also implemented for comparison. In this
   approach, updating model parameters are estimated to minimize the
   discrepancies between the identified and model-predicted modal
   parameters of the turbine. The performance of these two approaches are
   studied on a 2-MW offshore wind turbine at the Blyth wind farm in the
   United Kingdom. Strain response time history at mudline is estimated
   through both approaches and compared with actual measurements for
   validation. It is observed that both approaches are capable of accurate
   response prediction while the Bayesian approach leads to slightly better
   results. Furthermore, the Bayesian approach allows for identification of
   input loads and uncertainty quantification.},

Abstract = {Wind energy is one of the most versatile and promising sustainable
   energy solutions. Wind energy can be harvested in both onshore and
   offshore environments. Due to the environmental and societal impacts of
   onshore wind farms, the focus on developing offshore wind farms has been
   steadily increasing. For deep-water areas, floating wind turbine
   solutions have been developed in the past two decades. Each wind turbine
   is mounted on a floating structure and connected to a mooring system.
   While the floating wind turbine technology enables electricity
   generation in water depths where fixed-foundation turbines are not
   feasible, operation and maintenance (O\&M) have become serious issues.
   This paper investigates the challenges and potential enabling
   technologies for the development of autonomous floating offshore wind
   farms. In particular, the paper explores the potential utilization of
   information and communication technology (ICT) and robotics toward fully
   autonomous floating offshore wind farm O\&M, aiming for cost reduction
   and improved operational safety. The presented solutions cover
   fundamental aspects in floating platform design, remote operation in the
   form of digital twins, autonomous underwater robots and surface
   vehicles, and eco-friendly energy storage.},

Abstract = {This study introduces a Digital Twin (DT) framework for the reliability
   assessment of wind turbine power modules. Its importance is demonstrated
   by examining the effect of wind turbulence on the electrothermal
   behaviour and lifetime of machine side power electronic converters and
   semiconductor devices of direct-drive wind turbines. To this end, an
   electrothermal model embedded in a turbine model is established, which
   tracks the changes in wind speed. Using realworld, 1-sec wind speed
   data, the real device junction temperature profiles and the fatigue
   experienced by the semiconductor devices are examined for two 10-min
   periods. Then, these metrics are compared with the corresponding metrics
   of the same 10-min periods when the wind speed is assumed constant and
   equal to the 10-min average value, which is often used in traditional
   device reliability assessment methods using SCADA data. Based on
   simulation results, the fatigue experienced by the semiconductor devices
   due to sudden fluctuations of the wind is found to be significantly
   higher than the fatigue estimated by traditional reliability assessment
   methods using the SCADA data. Two methods that attempt to reconstruct
   the wind spectrum (Random Walk MetropolisHastings algorithm) and
   compress the wind speed data (Discrete Wavelet Transform) are proposed.
   These and/or other similar methods may be integrated into the DT
   interface to address the issue of the large volume of data required to
   be stored in DTs.},

Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {268},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {As one of the most promising clean energy sources, offshore wind farms
   (OWFs) have developed rapidly in countries around the world. However,
   due to complex weather and geological environments and increasing
   distance from the shore, operations and maintenance (O\&M) costs of OWFs
   are much higher than those of other clean energy sources, accounting for
   as much as 30\% of total life-cycle costs. Issues such as OWFs system
   reliability, O\&M operator safety and ecological protection issues also
   become more and more prominent. To address these challenges, this paper
   reviews the latest research progress on digital twin (DT) technology
   targeting on OWFs O\&M, including failure analysis, O\&M objectives,
   strategies \& optimization models, DT technology development, as well as
   DT-based O\&M management and optimization. A DT-based O\&M optimization
   framework is proposed which helps to improve the intelligence level of
   O\&M. Computation of the value of a DT model is discussed and
   value-informed DT model development is proposed. Promising research
   areas on O\&M optimization are identified.},

Title = {Online condition monitoring of floating wind turbines drivetrain by

Journal = {MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {162},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {This paper presents a digital twin (DT) condition monitoring approach
   for drivetrains on floating offshore wind turbines. Digital twin in this
   context consists of torsional dynamic model, online measurements and
   fatigue damage estimation which is used for remaining useful life (RUL)
   estimation. At first, methods for system parameter estimation are
   presented. The digital twin model provides sufficient inputs for the
   load observers designed in specific points of the drivetrain to estimate
   the online load and subsequently stress in the different components. The
   estimated real-time stress values feed the degradation model of the
   components. The stochastic degradation model proposed for estimation of
   real-time fatigue damage in the components is based on a proven
   model-based approach which is tested under different drivetrain
   operations, namely normal, faulty and overload conditions. The
   uncertainties in model, measurements and material properties are
   addressed, and confidence interval for the estimations is provided by a
   detailed analysis on the signal behavior and using Monte Carlo
   simulations. A test case, using 10 MW drivetrain, has been demonstrated.},

Title = {Progress on Offshore Wind Farm Dynamic Wake Management for Energy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The wake management of offshore wind farms (OWFs) mainly considers the
   wake effect. Wake effects commonly occur in offshore wind farms, which
   cause a 5-10\% reduction in power production. Although there have been
   many studies on wake management, many methods are not accurate enough;
   for instance, look-up table and static wake model control methods do not
   consider the time-varying wake state. Dynamic wake management is based
   on the real-time dynamic wake, so it can increase the energy of the OWFs
   effectively. For OWFs, dynamic wake control is the main method of
   dynamic wake management. In this paper, the existing wake model and
   control progress are discussed, mainly emphasizing the dynamic wake
   model and the dynamic wake control method, solving the gap of the review
   for dynamic wake management. This paper presents a digital twins (DT)
   framework for power and fatigue damage for the first time.. The
   structure of this paper is as follows: (1) the mechanism of wind farm
   wake interference is described and then the dynamic wake model is
   reviewed and summarized; (2) different control methods are analyzed and
   the dynamic wake management strategies for different control methods are
   reviewed; (3) in order to solve the problems of dynamic wake detection
   and real-time effective control, the technology of DT is applied to the
   dynamic wake control of OWFs. This new DT frame has a promising
   application prospect in improving power and reducing fatigue damage.},

Abstract = {Offshore wind energy is playing an increasingly vital role in the clean
   energy transition around the world, and improved reliability of wind
   turbine structures is necessary for the long-term success and efficiency
   of renewable energy. Increased reliability would reduce costs associated
   with maintenance due to breakages and in turn reduce the levelized cost
   of energy for offshore wind energy sources. Structural health monitoring
   methods can be used to predict breakages and extend lifetimes by
   continuously monitoring instrumented structures. This paper presents
   system identification and model updating of a 6 MW offshore wind turbine
   using vibration measurements under varying operational conditions. The
   turbine is monopile-supported and instrumented with strain gauges and
   accelerometers at several elevations along the tower and monopile.
   Effective stiffness of soil springs in the model are updated to match
   modal-predicted natural frequencies and mode shapes of the first two
   modes with those identified from measurements at different operating
   conditions. A deterministic and probabilistic (Bayesian) approach to
   model updating are compared. The sensitivity of identified modal
   parameters and the updated model parameters are investigated with
   respect to operational and environmental conditions such as wind speed.
   Results show that deterministic model updating can match modal
   parameters with high accuracy across datasets and environmental
   conditions. Bayesian model updating results successfully estimate the
   posterior distribution of updating model parameters with an increasing
   degree of certainty as more data is used.},

Abstract = {Offshore Wind Power Systems (OWPS) offer great energy and environmental
   advantages, but also pose significant Operation and Maintenance (O \& M)
   challenges. In this survey, we analyze these challenges and propose some
   optimization strategies and technologies for OWPS comprehensively. The
   existing literature review mainly focuses on a certain field of offshore
   wind power O \& M, but lacks a comprehensive introduction to offshore
   wind power. We consider the energy efficiency, reliability, safety, and
   economy of OWPS from various aspects, such as offshore wind and wave
   energy utilization, offshore wind turbine components, and wind power
   operation parameters, and compare them with onshore wind power systems.
   We suggest that OWPS can benefit from advanced design optimization,
   digital twin, monitoring and forecasting, fault diagnosis, and other
   technologies to enhance their O \& M performance. This paper aims to
   provide theoretical guidance and practical reference for the
   technological innovation and sustainable development of OWPS.},

Title = {Progress and Trends in Damage Detection Methods, Maintenance, and

Abstract = {In recent decades, renewable energy has attracted attention as a viable
   energy supply. Among renewable energy sources, offshore wind energy has
   been considerably growing since longer and larger wind tur-bine
   composite blades were deployed. The manufacture of the longer and larger
   composite blades leads to more wind energy production. However, the wind
   turbine composite blades are susceptible to damage and defects due to
   multiple structural loads and harsh operating environments in service.
   Hence, condi-tion monitoring and maintenance of wind turbine composite
   blades require in-depth investigation to prevent structural damage and
   defects and to improve remaining lifetime of the composite structure.
   The types of damage and defects in wind turbine composite blades are
   typically delamination, debonding, and cracks, which are influenced by
   the intrinsic structural nonlinearities, manufacturing process stage,
   and harsh environmental impacts in service. For these reasons, the
   regular condition monitoring of the composite blades is required to
   assess degradation in performance and structural condition to minimise
   levelised energy costs for maintenance. To improve reliability and
   sustainability, data-driven inspection with digital twin technology is
   reviewed as a trend of condition monitoring frameworks. Advanced
   func-tional materials to potentially assist current non-destructive
   testing (NDT) methods or to be utilised as self-sensing performance are
   reviewed. From manufacturing to the system level, a comprehensive review
   on progress and trends of monitoring of wind turbine composite blades is
   carried out including physics-based NDT methods, data fusion in sensor
   networks, automated system, mechanics, and digital twin tech-nology with
   the environmental coupling.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {In the wind energy industry, a cost-benefit digital twin (DT) will be
   very useful for managing the operation of a wind turbine. For instance,
   a DT could provide information on the structural health conditions in
   real-time as well as projections in the near future. This allows wind
   farm operators to proactively plan maintenance visits, limiting down
   time. A DT is also invaluable when it comes to playing out ``what if{''}
   scenarios. For instance, wind farm operators could use a DT to predict
   what might happen if they keep a high-power rate under a strong wind.
   The ability to rapidly play out these cost-benefit models helps to
   optimize the performance of the turbine and generally the whole wind
   farm. In this work, we employ component-based Reduced-Order Modelling
   (ROM) techniques to construct a DT of the National Renewable Energy
   Laboratory (NREL) 5MW wind turbine. The DT consists of a ROM model for
   modal analysis and for structural response prediction under wind
   loading. First, an offline library is pre-computed, which contains a
   series of component archetypes. Then, the component-based ROM is
   assembled out of these archetypes such as the parts in blade, hub,
   nacelle, and tower. The wind loading on the turbine is predicted with
   inputs of far-field wind. With very fast computation speed of the ROM
   model, the DT could be able to provide almost instant predictions of the
   modes and the responses of the turbine structure.},

Title = {Fault detection of offshore wind turbine drivetrains in different

   measurements},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {203},
Pages = {161-176},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this study, a vibration-based fault detection method is proposed for
   offshore wind turbine drivetrain based on the optimal selection of the
   acceleration measurements. The main aim is to find the sensor positions
   mounted on the drivetrain that provides the most fault-related
   information. In fact, this study tries to optimize the vibration sensors
   suggested by ISO standards in terms of their position and number in
   order to get accurate fault detection results. The faults are considered
   in a set of bearings with a high probability of failure in a 5-MW
   reference drivetrain high-fidelity model installed on a spar-type
   floating wind turbine. Different simulated shaft acceleration
   measurements are examined under three environmental conditions.
   Correlation analysis is first performed on the measurements to see how
   the different faults and environmental conditions affect the correlation
   between the measurements. Then, a combined principal component analysis
   (PCA) and convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed as the fault
   detection method through the optimal vibration measurements. The
   prediction findings demonstrate that only two vibration sensors, one
   near the main shaft and another near the intermediate-speed shaft, can
   fully detect the considered faulty bearings. Also, it will be shown that
   the axial vibration data give more promising results than the radial
   ones which can be used in virtual digital twin models.},

Abstract = {In this article a virtual sensor for online load monitoring and
   subsequent remaining useful life (RUL) assessment of wind turbine
   gearbox bearings is presented. Utilizing a Digital Twin framework the
   virtual sensor combines data from readily available sensors of the
   condition monitoring (CMS) and supervisory control and data acquisition
   (SCADA) system with a physics-based gearbox model. Different state
   estimation methods including Kalman filter, Least-square estimator, and
   a quasi-static approach are employed for load estimation. For RUL
   assessment the accumulated fatigue damage is calculated with the
   Palmgren-Miner model. A case study using simulation measurements from a
   high-fidelity gearbox model is conducted to evaluate the proposed
   method. Estimated loads at the considered intermediate and high-speed
   shaft bearings show moderate to high correlation (R = 0.50 - 0.96) to
   measurements, as lower frequency internal dynamics are not fully
   captured. The estimated fatigue damage differs by 5-15\% from
   measurements.},

Abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) has been recognized as a useful tool
   for safety management and risk reduction of offshore wind farms. In
   complex offshore environment, jacket structures of offshore wind
   turbines are prone to damages due to corrosion and fatigue. Effective
   SHM on jacket structures can substantially reduce their operation risk
   and costs. This work reviews the latest progress on the SHM of offshore
   wind jacket structures. The achievements in the structural damage
   identification, location, quantification, and remaining useful life
   (RUL) estimation are respectively introduced in detail, and existing
   challenges are discussed. Possible solutions to the challenges using the
   Digital Twin (DT) technology are put forward. The DT is able to mirror a
   real jacket structure into a virtual model, and Bayesian updating can
   refresh the virtual model parameters in real-time to keep consistency
   between virtual model and physical structure; then, just-in-time SHM can
   be carried out for jacket structures by performing damage detection,
   location, quantification, and RUL estimation using the virtual model. As
   a result, the DT may provide engineers and researchers a practicable
   tool for safety monitoring and risk reduction of fixed foundation
   offshore wind structures.},

Title = {Mapping damages from inspection images to 3D digital twins of
   large-scale structures},
Journal = {ENGINEERING REPORTS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 1},
Abstract = {This study develops a methodology to create detailed visual Digital
   Twins of large-scale structures with their realistic damages detected
   from visual inspection or nondestructive testing. The methodology is
   demonstrated with a transition piece of an offshore wind turbine and a
   composite rotor blade, with surface paint damage and subsurface
   delamination damage, respectively. Artificial Intelligence and color
   threshold segmentation are used to classify and localize damages from
   optical images taken by drones. These damages are digitalized and mapped
   to a 3D geometry reconstruction of the large-scale structure or a CAD
   model of the structure. To map the images from 2D to 3D, metadata
   information is combined with the geo placement of the large-scale
   structure's 3D model. The 3D model can here both be a CAD model of the
   structure or a 3D reconstruction based on photogrammetry. After mapping
   the damage, the Digital Twin gives an accurate representation of the
   structure. The location, shape, and size of the damage are visible on
   the Digital Twin. The demonstrated methodology can be applied to
   industrial sectors such as wind energy, the oil and gas industry, marine
   and aerospace to facilitate asset management.},

Title = {Deep-Learning-Based Pitch Controller for Floating Offshore Wind Turbine
   Systems with Compensation for Delay of Hydraulic Actuators},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The pitch controller of a floating offshore wind power system has an
   important influence on the power generation and movement of the floating
   body. It drives the turbine blade pitch using a hydraulic actuator,
   whose inherent characteristics cause a delay in response, which
   increases with the system capacity. As a result, the power generation is
   reduced, and the pitch motion of the floating body is increased. This
   paper proposes an advanced pitch controller designed to compensate for
   the delay in the hydraulic actuator response. The proposed pitch
   controller applies an artificial-intelligence-based deep learning
   algorithm to predict the delay time in the hydraulic actuator. This
   delay is compensated for by preferentially predicting the blade pitch
   control angle even if a delay occurs in the hydraulic actuator. The
   performance of the proposed pitch controller was analyzed using the
   Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence (FAST) v8 model
   developed by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory and was
   compared against that of the ideal pitch controller and the pitch
   controller that reflects the response delay. Compared with the latter,
   the proposed method increased the average power generation by
   approximately 5\% and reduced the standard deviation of the floating
   body's pitch motion by approximately 50\%.},

Abstract = {In this work, a digital twin with standalone, descriptive, and
   predictive capabilities is created for an existing onshore wind farm
   located in complex terrain. A standalone digital twin is implemented
   with a virtual-reality-enabled 3D interface using openly available data
   on the turbines and their environment. Real SCADA data from the wind
   farm are being used to elevate the digital twin to the descriptive
   level. The data are complemented with weather forecasts from a
   microscale model nested into Scandinavian meteorological forecasts, and
   wind resources are visualized inside the human-machine interface.
   Finally, the weather data are used to infer predictions on the hourly
   power production of each turbine and the whole wind farm with a 61 hours
   forecasting horizon. The digital twin provides a data platform and
   interface for power predictions with a visual explanation of the
   prediction, and it serves as a basis for future work on digital twins.},

Abstract = {Offshore wind turbines founded on monopiles are highly dynamic
   structures in which the stiffness of the soil adjacent to the monopile
   controls the natural frequency of the structure. As the loading regime
   and ground conditions surrounding the foundation are subject to
   considerable uncertainty, adaptable digital twins of the offshore
   structures are valuable as they allow the use of in-field monitoring
   data for model updating. As soil conditions and water depths are rarely
   uniform across a wind farm site, each structure is expected to behave
   differently. To back-analyse structural performance, geotechnical and
   structural data needs to be retrieved at every foundation location. A
   serverless cloud-based application was developed to allow quick and
   reliable storage and retrieval of geotechnical and structural data. The
   database was combined with an API layer to allow parametric data
   retrieval for back-analyses and digital twin updating across an entire
   wind farm. As the web application is hosted in the cloud, the data can
   be accessed through simple HTTP requests by authenticated users working
   offshore, in the office or remote. The performance of this solution is
   illustrated with a case study in which foundation stiffness across an
   entire wind farm site is parametrically calculated and updated.},

Title = {Floating offshore wind turbine mooring line sections health status
   nowcasting: From supervised shallow to weakly supervised deep learning},
Journal = {MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {216},

Abstract = {The global installed capacity of floating offshore wind turbines is
   projected to increase by at least 100 times over the next decades.
   Station-keeping of floating offshore renewable energy devices is
   achieved through the use of mooring systems. Mooring systems are exposed
   to a variety of environmental and operational conditions that cause
   corrosion, abrasion, and fatigue. Regular physical in-service
   inspections of mooring systems are the golden standard for monitoring
   their health status. This approach is often expensive, inefficient, and
   unsafe, and for this reason, researchers are focusing on developing
   tools for digital solutions for real -time monitoring. Floating offshore
   renewable energy devices are usually equipped with a wide range of
   sensors, some low-cost, low/zero maintenance, and easily deployable (
   e.g. , accelerometers on the tower), contrary to others ( e.g. , direct
   tension mooring line measurements), producing real -time data streams.
   In this paper, we propose exploiting the data coming from the first type
   of sensors for mooring systems health status nowcasting. In particular,
   we will first rely on state-of-the-art supervised shallow and deep
   learning models for predicting the health status of the different
   sections of the mooring lines. Then, since these supervised models
   require types and amount of data that are seldom available, we will
   propose new shallow and deep weekly supervised models that require a
   very small amount of data regarding worn mooring lines. Results will
   show that these last models can potentially have practical applicability
   and impact for real -time monitoring of mooring systems in the near
   future. In order to support our statements, we will make use of data
   generated with a state-of-the-art digital twin of the mooring system,
   OrcaFlex 1 , for a floating offshore wind turbine reproducing the
   physical mechanism of the mooring degradation under different loads and
   environmental conditions. Results will show errors around 1\% in the
   simplest scenario and errors around 4\% in the most challenging one,
   confirming the potentiality of the proposed approaches.},

Abstract = {The digitalization of wind power generation is rapidly progressing with
   the development of ICT technologies such as big data, IoT, and
   artificial intelligence, along with the trend of large-scale wind power
   generation and the expansion of offshore wind power generation. As the
   number of wind turbines installed in power generation complexes
   decreases due to the increasing size of turbines, the availability,
   reliability, efficiency, and lifespan of each wind turbine are becoming
   increasingly important. In particular, digital twin technology for
   high-efficiency operation is expected to accelerate due to the
   large-scale expansion of offshore wind power and the increase in
   operation and maintenance (O\&M) costs resulting from the scale and
   aging of turbines. In this paper, we intend to establish a foundation
   for extending the lifespan of wind turbines through performance analysis
   and durability evaluation of Korean wind turbines, as well as the
   development of remaining life prediction technology. To predict the
   remaining life of a wind turbine, we selected crucial components based
   on failure rates and downtime, focusing on identifying the core parts of
   the turbine. Actual SCADA and CMS operational data for key components
   were acquired, and system performance was analyzed using artificial
   intelligence and knowledge-based condition diagnosis algorithms. The
   remaining life prediction program will be enhanced using real-time
   sensor data obtained from the following performance analysis. The final
   outcome will be applied to real wind turbines in Korea for a long-term
   demonstration.},
