AB  - Smart manufacturing, tailored by the 4th industrial revolution and forces like 
      innovation, competition, and changing demands, lies behind the concurrent 
      evolution (also known as co-evolution) of products, processes and production 
      systems. Manufacturing companies need to adapt to ever-changing environments by 
      simultaneously reforming and regenerating their product, process, and system 
      models as well as goals and strategies to stay competitive. However, the 
      ever-increasing complexity and ever-shortening lifecycles of product, process and 
      system domains challenge manufacturing organization's conventional approaches to 
      analysing and formalizing models and processes as well as management, maintenance 
      and simulation of product and system life cycles. The digital twin-based virtual 
      factory (VF) concept, as an integrated simulation model of a factory including 
      its subsystems, is promising for supporting manufacturing organizations in 
      adapting to dynamic and complex environments. In this paper, we present the 
      demonstration and evaluation of previously introduced digital twin-based VF 
      concept to support modelling, simulation and evaluation of complex manufacturing 
      systems while employing multi-user collaborative virtual reality (VR) 
      learning/training scenarios. The concept is demonstrated and evaluated using two 
      different wind turbine manufacturing cases, including a wind blade manufacturing 
      plant and a nacelle assembly line. Thirteen industry experts who have diverse 
      backgrounds and expertise were interviewed after their participation in a 
      demonstration. We present the experts' discussions and arguments to evaluate the 
      DT-based VF concept based on four dimensions, namely, dynamic, open, cognitive, 
      and holistic systems. The semi-structured conversational interview results show 
      that the DT-based VF stands out by having the potential to support concurrent 
      engineering by virtual collaboration. Moreover, DT-based VF is promising for 
      decreasing physical builds and saving time by virtual prototyping (VP).

TI  - 5G-enabled, battery-less smart skins for self-monitoring megastructures and 
      digital twin applications.
PG  - 10002

AB  - With the current development of the 5G infrastructure, there presents a unique 
      opportunity for the deployment of battery-less mmWave reflect-array-based 
      sensors. These fully-passive devices benefit from having a larger detectability 
      than alternative battery-less solutions to create self-monitoring megastructures. 
      The presented 'smart' skin sensor uses a Van-Atta array design enabling 
      ubiquitous local strain monitoring for the structural health monitoring of 
      composite materials featuring wide interrogation angles. Proof-of-concept 
      prototypes of these 'smart' skin millimeter-wave identification tags, that can be 
      mounted on or embedded within common materials used in wind turbine blades, 
      present a highly-detectable radar cross-section of - 33.75 dBsm and - 35.00 dBsm 
      for mounted and embedded sensors respectively. Both sensors display a minimum 
      resolution of 202 μ -strain even at 40 ∘ off-axis enabling interrogation of the 
      fully-passive sensor at oblique angles of incidence. When interrogated from a 
      proof-of-concept reader, the fully-passive, sticker-like mmID enables local 
      strain monitoring of both carbon fiber and glass fiber composite materials. The 
      sensors display a repeatable and recoverable response over 0-3000 μ -strain and a 
      sensitivity of 7.55 kHz/ μ -strain and 7.92 kHz/ μ -strain for mounted and 
      embedded sensors, respectively. Thus, the presented 5G-enabled battery-less 
      sensor presents massive potential for the development of ubiquitous Digital 
      Twinning of composite materials in future smart cities architectures.

TI  - Towards a Distributed Digital Twin Framework for Predictive Maintenance in 
      Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).
LID - 10.3390/s24082663 [doi]
LID - 2663
AB  - This study uses a wind turbine case study as a subdomain of Industrial Internet 
      of Things (IIoT) to showcase an architecture for implementing a distributed 
      digital twin in which all important aspects of a predictive maintenance solution 
      in a DT use a fog computing paradigm, and the typical predictive maintenance DT 
      is improved to offer better asset utilization and management through real-time 
      condition monitoring, predictive analytics, and health management of selected 
      components of wind turbines in a wind farm. Digital twin (DT) is a technology 
      that sits at the intersection of Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, and 
      Software Engineering to provide a suitable tool for replicating physical objects 
      in the digital space. This can facilitate the implementation of asset management 
      in manufacturing systems through predictive maintenance solutions leveraged by 
      machine learning (ML). With DTs, a solution architecture can easily use data and 
      software to implement asset management solutions such as condition monitoring and 
      predictive maintenance using acquired sensor data from physical objects and 
      computing capabilities in the digital space. While DT offers a good solution, it 
      is an emerging technology that could be improved with better standards, 
      architectural framework, and implementation methodologies. Researchers in both 
      academia and industry have showcased DT implementations with different levels of 
      success. However, DTs remain limited in standards and architectures that offer 
      efficient predictive maintenance solutions with real-time sensor data and 
      intelligent DT capabilities. An appropriate feedback mechanism is also needed to 
      improve asset management operations.

TI  - Towards Digital Twins of the Oceans: The Potential of Machine Learning for 
      Monitoring the Impacts of Offshore Wind Farms on Marine Environments.
LID - 10.3390/s23104581 [doi]
LID - 4581
AB  - With an increasing number of offshore wind farms, monitoring and evaluating the 
      effects of the wind turbines on the marine environment have become important 
      tasks. Here we conducted a feasibility study with the focus on monitoring these 
      effects by utilizing different machine learning methods. A multi-source dataset 
      for a study site in the North Sea is created by combining satellite data, local 
      in situ data and a hydrodynamic model. The machine learning algorithm DTWkNN, 
      which is based on dynamic time warping and k-nearest neighbor, is used for 
      multivariate time series data imputation. Subsequently, unsupervised anomaly 
      detection is performed to identify possible inferences in the dynamic and 
      interdepending marine environment around the offshore wind farm. The anomaly 
      results are analyzed in terms of location, density and temporal variability, 
      granting access to information and building a basis for explanation. Temporal 
      detection of anomalies with COPOD is found to be a suitable method. Actionable 
      insights are the direction and magnitude of potential effects of the wind farm on 
      the marine environment, depending on the wind direction. This study works towards 
      a digital twin of offshore wind farms and provides a set of methods based on 
      machine learning to monitor and evaluate offshore wind farm effects, supporting 
      stakeholders with information for decision making on future maritime energy 
      infrastructures.

TI  - Developing DELPHI expert consensus rules for a digital twin model of acute stroke 
      care in the neuro critical care unit.
PG  - 161
LID - 10.1186/s12883-023-03192-9 [doi]

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Digital twins, a form of artificial intelligence, are virtual 
      representations of the physical world. In the past 20 years, digital twins have 
      been utilized to track wind turbines' operations, monitor spacecraft's status, 
      and even create a model of the Earth for climate research. While digital twins 
      hold much promise for the neurocritical care unit, the question remains on how to 
      best establish the rules that govern these models. This model will expand on our 
      group's existing digital twin model for the treatment of sepsis. METHODS: The 
      authors of this project collaborated to create a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) and 
      an initial series of 20 DELPHI statements, each with six accompanying 
      sub-statements that captured the pathophysiology surrounding the management of 
      acute ischemic strokes in the practice of Neurocritical Care (NCC). Agreement 
      from a panel of 18 experts in the field of NCC was collected through a 7-point 
      Likert scale with consensus defined a-priori by ≥ 80% selection of a 6 ("agree") 
      or 7 ("strongly agree"). The endpoint of the study was defined as the completion 
      of three separate rounds of DELPHI consensus. DELPHI statements that had met 
      consensus would not be included in subsequent rounds of DELPHI consensus. The 
      authors refined DELPHI statements that did not reach consensus with the guidance 
      of de-identified expert comments for subsequent rounds of DELPHI. All DELPHI 
      statements that reached consensus by the end of three rounds of DELPHI consensus 
      would go on to be used to inform the construction of the digital twin model. 
      RESULTS: After the completion of three rounds of DELPHI, 93 (77.5%) statements 
      reached consensus, 11 (9.2%) statements were excluded, and 16 (13.3%) statements 
      did not reach a consensus of the original 120 DELPHI statements. CONCLUSION: This 
      descriptive study demonstrates the use of the DELPHI process to generate 
      consensus among experts and establish a set of rules for the development of a 
      digital twin model for use in the neurologic ICU. Compared to associative models 
      of AI, which develop rules based on finding associations in datasets, digital 
      twin AI created by the DELPHI process are easily interpretable models based on a 
      current understanding of underlying physiology.
