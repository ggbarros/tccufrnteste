	abstract = {In recent decades, renewable energy has attracted attention as a viable energy supply. Among renewable energy sources, offshore wind energy has been considerably growing since longer and larger wind turbine composite blades were deployed. The manufacture of the longer and larger composite blades leads to more wind energy production. However, the wind turbine composite blades are susceptible to damage and defects due to multiple structural loads and harsh operating environments in service. Hence, condition monitoring and maintenance of wind turbine composite blades require in-depth investigation to prevent structural damage and defects and to improve remaining lifetime of the composite structure. The types of damage and defects in wind turbine composite blades are typically delamination, debonding, and cracks, which are influenced by the intrinsic structural nonlinearities, manufacturing process stage, and harsh environmental impacts in service. For these reasons, the regular condition monitoring of the composite blades is required to assess degradation in performance and structural condition to minimise levelised energy costs for maintenance. To improve reliability and sustainability, data-driven inspection with digital twin technology is reviewed as a trend of condition monitoring frameworks. Advanced functional materials to potentially assist current non-destructive testing (NDT) methods or to be utilised as self-sensing performance are reviewed. From manufacturing to the system level, a comprehensive review on progress and trends of monitoring of wind turbine composite blades is carried out including physics-based NDT methods, data fusion in sensor networks, automated system, mechanics, and digital twin technology with the environmental coupling. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {In the present study, a structural health monitoring (SHM) method for floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) is suggested and tested using operational modal analysis (OMA) with numerical-sensor signals. The numerical accelerometer signals along the tower and blade of FOWT in dynamic wind field are used for the OMA. The numerical-sensor signals are simulated using a time-domain turbine-floater-mooring fully-coupled dynamic simulation computer program. To perform the SHM of a FOWT through OMA, natural frequencies, displacement mode shapes (DMS), and curvature mode shapes (CMS) of the tower and blades are obtained and analyzed. The modal properties are systematically compared between the intact and damaged conditions. Their differences are used for damage detection. The results show that CMS is found to be the most effective modal property to detect damage locations and intensities. The performance of the damage detection based on the OMA-CMS analysis is verified by independent FEM (finite element method) results. This study is unique in that the SHM using OMA and CMS for FOWTs is implemented including the floater-tower-blade coupling effects. The technology can contribute to the design of remote SHM system for future FOWTs. A further validated model with field data may build up a huge database for various damage scenarios so that it can be applied to digital-twin-based smart health monitoring technology. © 2019},

	abstract = {In the wind energy industry, a digital twin (DT) is very useful for managing the operation of a wind turbine and predicting structural health conditions in real-time as well as projections in the near future. A real-time surrogate model is a very crucial part in building a DT. Towards that end, we employ a Reduced-Order Modelling (ROM) approach to construct a surrogate model for the environment-structure system of a bottom-fixed offshore wind turbine (OWT). The entire environment-structure system is broken down into major sub-systems of wind, wave, and structure. Based on the high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data, the wind ROM model can quickly provide the loadings on the components above water level in the parameter space spanned by the incoming wind speed, the rotational speed of the rotor, the pitch and tilt angles of the turbine. The hydro loadings on the underwater components of the OWT are solved by the empirical Morison formula. The OWT structural ROM model is component-based consisting of blades, hub, nacelle, tower, and monopile. The structural ROM model takes the loading data feeds from the wind and wave models to predict the structure responses of the OWT system, including stress. Since the DT is constructed via the component-based, it can also be used to play out “what if” scenarios when there are component level changes. For instance, the model can predict the system response of OWT when certain parts undergo structure failures. Benefiting from the cost-efficient ROM models, the DT is over two orders of magnitude faster than high-fidelity simulations while maintaining good accuracy. Copyright © 2023 by ASME.},

This paper presents a review of corrosion fatigue research in horizontal-axis offshore wind turbines (HAOWT) support structures, including the current trends in using digital tools that address the current state of asset integrity monitoring. Based on the conducted review, it has been found that digital twins incorporating finite element analysis, material characterisation and modelling, machine learning using artificial neural networks, data analytics, and internet of things (IoT) using smart sensor technologies, can be enablers for tackling the challenges in corrosion fatigue (CF) assessment of offshore wind turbines in shallow and deep waters. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Over the course of the last four decades, the rotor diameter of Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWTs) has undergone a substantial increase, expanding from 15 m (30 kW) to an impressive 240 m (15MW), primarily aimed at enhancing their power generation capacity. This growth in blade swept area, however, gives rise to heightened loads, stresses and deflections, imposing more rigorous demands on the structural robustness of these components. To prevent sudden failure and to plan effective inspection, maintenance, and repair activities, it is vital to estimate the reliability of the rotor blades by considering all the forces (aerodynamic and structural dynamics) acting on them over the turbine's lifespan. This research proposes a comprehensive methodology that seamlessly combines fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulation, Kriging model/algorithm and Adaptive Kriging Monte Carlo Simulation (AKMCS) to assess the reliability of the HAWT rotor blades. Firstly, high-fidelity FSI simulations are performed to investigate the dynamic response of the rotor blade under varying wind conditions. Recognizing the computationally intensive nature and time-consuming aspects of FSI simulations, a judicious approach involves harnessing an economical Kriging model as a surrogate. This surrogate model adeptly predicts blade deflection along its length, utilizing training and testing data derived from FSI simulations. Impressively, the Kriging model predicts blade deflection 400 times faster than the FSI simulations, showcasing its enhanced efficiency. The optimized surrogate model is then used to estimate the flap wise blade tip deflection for one million wind speed samples generated using Weibull distribution. Thereafter, to evaluate the reliability of the blades, statistical modeling using methods such as Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS), AKMCS is performed. The results demonstrate the faster convergence of AKMCS requiring only 21 samples, as opposed to 1 million samples for MCS with minimal reduction in the precision of the estimated probability of failure (Pf) and reliability index (β). Demonstrated on the backdrop of an IEA-15MW offshore reference WT rotor blade, the proposed methodology underscores its potential to be seamlessly incorporated into the creation of WT digital twins, due to its near real-time predictive capabilities for Pf and β assessments. © 2023},

	abstract = {The computational cost of the design optimisation of wind turbines, as well as the optimisation of the operation and maintenance of offshore wind farms represents a limitation to the application of conventional simulation methods. New techniques such as reduced order modelling (ROM) and technologies such as hybrid-analysis methods and digital twins have increased in popularity due to their ability to deliver numerical results at a significant speedup with reasonable accuracy. This work presents a hybrid projection-based proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) strategy applied to transient turbulent flow problems. Key feature of this work is the applicability of the methodology to high Reynolds number cases and the stabilisation of pressure in the online phase via the assembly of the so-called pressure Poisson equation. Another significant part of this work is the implementation of an interpolation scheme for the eddy viscosity field in the classical POD-Galerkin strategy. The sampling procedure and the calculation of the reduced operators in the offline phase is carried out using the finite volume method (FVM), OpenFOAM's libraries specifically, while the construction of the reduced basis and the solution of the online phase is carried out in Python. The capability of the resulting ROM is tested using the two-dimensional flow around a NACA0015 airfoil at 17° angle of attack with Reynolds number of approximately 300 000. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

	abstract = {This report reviews the recent advances of the past years in ships and offshore structural testing area including scaling laws, DIC, hydrodynamic of flexible structures, wave-in-deck, hybrid model testing, corrosion testing, iced load measurements, health monitoring model and digital twin model. The following summary and recommendations are made for future work in the area of innovative experimental methods in ships and offshore industry. It is important to also note that as experimental techniques allow for a greater understanding of the underlying material and structural behaviour, and generate extensive data clouds for processing and evaluation. As a result, we recommend that a future chapter in the next committee report focus on data evaluation and statistical approaches; this can provide an in-depth look of state of the art of processes utilized for evaluating the extensive data captured/utilized during experiments. In chapter 2, a review of scaling laws is presented in systematic and recent advancements in structural testing related to ships and offshore structures. General scale modelling methods are provided and described the main characteristics of each method such as dimensional analysis, applied to governing equation, energy method, empirical similarity method through the literature review. Recent application of scale models can be found in field of offshore wind turbine structure and ice testing area. These structures are subjected to complex phenomena such as wave loads and drifting forces may also need to be considered in particular applications, ice flows, continuous winter sea ice, and icebergs. Application DIC in chapter 3, DIC techniques have certainly come into play in many recent experimental evaluations, as the methods allows for elucidating the surface strain behaviour of a component evaluated either in the laboratory and in the field. This chapter has been to give an updated review on applications of DIC techniques in ships and offshore structural tests classifying them by test articles, with a brief insight on commercial instrumentations available on the industry and related to DIC society and a deeper focus on the applied methodologies, providing recent references for those who are interested in this topic. Worth mentioning is that some DIC applications are included in the benchmark study performed by the Committee and reported in section 15. In chapter 4, A large amount of research has focused on better measuring and predicting the hydrodynamic loads, forming several practical hydrodynamic coefficients databases which have been widely used in VIV prediction tools for flexible structure manufacturing industry. Although these databases make great contributions to the field of VIV research, have not been sufficiently modelled in the coefficient database obtained from rigid cylinder experiments. Recently, the phase angle between cross-flow and in-line response had a strong influence on the hydrodynamic coefficients for both rigid and flexible cylinders. And variations of tension and flow velocity were strongly correlated with time-varying hydrodynamic coefficients, therefore, inputs to the prediction of vessel motion induced VIVs, making the prediction possible. Also, the effects of Re numbers and surface roughness on hydrodynamics of VIV and the effect of wake interference on hydrodynamics of a twin-tube submerged floating tunnel (SFT) can be found for can efficient way and requirement in the literature. In chapter 5, based on the challenges remaining in the problem of wave-in-deck impact on offshore structures discussed above, there are several research gaps that can be addressed in future. There is still considerable uncertainty about the magnitude and distribution of wave impact loads on structural deck elements near the free-surface. Effects of the columns of the floating platform on the wave-in-deck forces have not been systematically studied. The measurement, estimation and simulation of local pressures due to wave-in-deck impact events on all types of offshore structures remains challenging. Accurate measurements and prediction of global loads and dynamic response of floating offshore structures due to wave-in-deck impact events is extremely limited. Combined numerical-experimental wave-in-deck investigations on floating offshore structures are not currently available in the open literature. In chapter 6, this chapter focused on hybrid model testing (HMT) combines physical model test and numerical simulations to solve problems that physical model tests alone cannot conveniently or reliably address. In marine model testing, the challenges like ultra-deep water, multi-phase fluids, parameter traversal and so on cannot be avoided. HMT is regarded as the most promising technique to solve these issues. As of today, HMT is still immature, some advanced applications however have been developed. HMT allows researchers to impose mass-spring-damping parameters in virtual space and can artificially adjust and precisely control these critical parameters. It is a very helpful and exciting idea to solve the involved problems. In Chapter 7, a brief reviewed of friction test in terms of two main areas exist where friction is of importance: machineries and mechanical connections, and in cargo/mechanical handling operations. For maritime and offshore applications (e.g. Out-of-Plane Bending), surface conditions and environmental conditions are important parameters. Small and the smaller specimens may be used for screening the theoretical friction coefficients and find trends. Larger or even real size specimens should be used to confirm the actual behaviour. As per the results of literature, friction tests can be split it eh standard, small size specimen standard tests, and the large size, more representative tests. While the standard tests are well covered by standards and guidelines, the larger set-ups are to be tailor made and require goo understanding of the physics as results require interpretation by the experimenter. In chapter 8, the measurement, analysis and mitigation of vibrations in ship and offshore structures is rather well established. Nevertheless, measurement and mitigation methods are still being developed. Measurement’s techniques may also include laser of video techniques. Mitigation measures include devices that cancel vibrations at a low weight penalty, such as absorbing supports or Tuned Mass Dampers. Numerical developments include methods that use sub-structuring or modal shapes to reduce the computational cost. In chapter 9, Material selection for ships and offshore structures exposed to sub-zero temperatures is traditionally based on Charpy and fracture toughness test results of the base materials and its welded connections. In the last years however, fatigue properties have been the focus of a couple of studies due to the acceleration of fatigue crack growth below the so-called fatigue transition temperature, where ductile crack growth is superimposed by cleavage burst. Concluding, fatigue testing at low temperatures demands special attention to the set-up and instrumentation. The testing temperature is normally lower than the application temperature, and liquid nitrogen may be needed to cool down the area of interest to -60 °C. Temperature compensation is required for sensor, either strain gauges or potential drop methods. In chapter 10, The corrosion process and the interpretation of the effect of corrosion on the structural integrity remains an area of uncertainty. In corrosion testing, a large spread may be observed in measured corrosion rates, as is confirmed by industrial thickness measurement. Including the geometrical effects of corrosion damage in a representative manner in numerical simulations requires the use of probabilistic methods, as a precise description would require model with too many details. Hence, simplifications and generalizations are needed. In chapter 11, large scale impact experimentation are unique options to verify developments in structures design, analysis and prediction of failure. In turn, this demands good command of the experimentation techniques, and the use of as many sensors as possible to make possible use of the results. In chapter 12, The chapter present a State-of-the-Art review, to include recent advances and future trends of industry challenge with current standard and out lookout. The wind industry is concerning with the long time-to-marked for future large turbine blades and are interested in ways to shorten the test time. It is a question at which size and when will it stop to make sense to test these long blades according to current standard. Trends of development of more advanced test methods investigated a dual or multi axis test methods to test blades under more representative loading compared to operational loads and ways to speed up the test and challenge with different SN-curves for different materials. Testing parts of blades captured testing with more complex and realistic loading at forced loading, challenges with boundaries, and using subcomponent testing to validate numerical models. In chapter 13, Full scale ice load measurements play a significant role in the design of ships and offshore structures in ice covered waters. Full scale measurements of fixed vertical offshore structure are dis-cussed here. Generalizability of the results can be summarised that as pointed out by Kärnä (2009) it is likely that the experimental data recorded on vertical structures is only applicable for the conditions where the data was record-ed. Thus, data recorded for stiff structures might not be applicable for compliant structures. As discussed before, the compliancy might be one source of the observed rate dependency. The collected data is often incomplete: although local and global ice forces can be recorded during ice action, the ice properties (compressive strength, porosity...) might remain unknown. It is because the ice samples cannot be taken during ice action - when ice is moving. Actual local pressure is challenging to measure. It is known that the ice pressure is concentrated in a small area as shown by Joensuu & Riska (1989). They observed in laboratory scale experiments using PVDF-film that the ice pressure is concentrated on narrow, line like high pressure zones. But, the area of the load panels in full scale of often quite big, in the order of 1 m2. Thus, the actual local pressure exerted to structure is significantly higher than the average pressure measured with the big load panels. But there is no method available for more accurate local pressure measurements in full scale. Although field tests are important and can reveal phenomena that cannot be observed in laboratory scale, there are few things to consider when interpreting the results. In chapter 14, Bridging the relationship between the degradation in the material and the structure is an emerging field of research which requires advanced data fusion, signal processing, AI-based trend detection algorithms and the reliability analysis methods. Data fusion herein refers to combining the data gathered from different SHM sensors by using data fusion algorithms for better damage diagnosis (Eleftheroglou et al., 2018). Other research efforts are recommended for improving the durability of SHM sensors for offshore implementations, inclusion of SHM in the condition monitoring standards and guidelines, addressing big-data issues for developing real-time data collection and analysis frameworks and using the digital twins for real-time reliability assessment. In the Benchmark study, from this relatively simple experiment performed by 6 parties, it is clear that a vast range of choices can be made to carry out the tests. Understanding the effect of the choices on the end result is essential. For instance, a heavy sensor influences the natural frequency a lot. Also, the chosen instrumentation influences the information to be gained from an experiment. Only the natural frequency, by manual excitation, or also damping and higher order modes when using an instrumented hammer. In order to understand the many experiments that are done worldwide, sharing of the results and being transparent on the methodologies of experimentation is very beneficial for making the most of any experiment. Experimental data should be published as is in digital format and not only as a by-product in a publication as figures limiting the use of it. © The Author(s), 2022.},

	abstract = {This study develops a methodology to create detailed visual Digital Twins of large-scale structures with their realistic damages detected from visual inspection or nondestructive testing. The methodology is demonstrated with a transition piece of an offshore wind turbine and a composite rotor blade, with surface paint damage and subsurface delamination damage, respectively. Artificial Intelligence and color threshold segmentation are used to classify and localize damages from optical images taken by drones. These damages are digitalized and mapped to a 3D geometry reconstruction of the large-scale structure or a CAD model of the structure. To map the images from 2D to 3D, metadata information is combined with the geo placement of the large-scale structure's 3D model. The 3D model can here both be a CAD model of the structure or a 3D reconstruction based on photogrammetry. After mapping the damage, the Digital Twin gives an accurate representation of the structure. The location, shape, and size of the damage are visible on the Digital Twin. The demonstrated methodology can be applied to industrial sectors such as wind energy, the oil and gas industry, marine and aerospace to facilitate asset management. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {In the wind energy industry, a cost-benefit digital twin (DT) will be very useful for managing the operation of a wind turbine. For instance, a DT could provide information on structural health conditions in real-time as well as projections for the near future. In this work, we employ a component-based Reduced-Order Modelling (ROM) technique to construct a DT of a parameter-varying offshore wind turbine system on a monopile. The DT consists of a ROM model for modal analysis and structural response prediction under wind and wave loadings. First, an offline library is pre-computed, which contains a series of component archetypes. Then, the component-based ROM is assembled out of these archetypes, such as the parts in the blade, hub, nacelle, and tower. With the computation speed of two orders (approximately 650x) faster than a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model and high accuracy (less than 0.2% error), the DT could be able to provide almost instant predictions of the modes and the responses of the turbine structure due to the wind-wave loading as well as projections of structural health conditions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},
