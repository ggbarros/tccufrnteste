	abstract = {As wind turbines continue to grow in size, they are increasingly being deployed offshore. This causes operation and maintenance of wind turbines becoming more challenging. Digitalization is a key enabling technology to manage wind farms in hostile environments and potentially increasing safety and reducing operational and maintenance costs. Digital infrastructure based on Industry 4.0 concept, such as digital twin, enables data collection, visualization, and analysis of wind power analytic at either individual turbine or wind farm level. In this paper, the concept of predictive digital twin for wind farm applications is introduced and demonstrated. To this end, a digital twin platform based on Unity3D for visualization and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC-UA) for data communication is developed. The platform is completed with the Prophet prediction algorithm to detect potential failure of wind turbine components in the near future and presented in augmented reality to enhance user experience. The presentation is intuitive and easy to use. The limitations of the platform include a lack of support for specific features like electronic signature, enhanced failover, and historical data sources. Simulation results based on the Hywind Tampen floating wind farm configuration show our proposed platform has promising potentials for offshore wind farm applications. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The number of offshore windmills keeps growing around the world since they are an essential part of any strategy to produce energy without using nuclear power plants or burning fossil resources. Due to the growing number of installations new monitoring and inspection strategies and routines need to be developed that are not only effective but efficient. In this work we will present first results from a joint project of industry partners and academia that aims at the development of new approaches making use of modern imaging technologies and new methods from artificial intelligence and computer vision research. We investigate three different strategies for collecting digital photos or video and posterior computational analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our results indicate, that patterns of interest like rust or coating damage can be detected and classified with F1 scores between 0.80 and 0.94 in photos collected by inspectors. In videos collected with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) rust patterns, oils spills and coating damage were detected with F1= 0.91. To support users in the time-consuming task of visual data exploration, we present a new visualization method referred to as 'virtual twin'. Using hand - recorded image collections, a data-driven 3D model of a windmill is generated, that can be used to investigate damage patterns in the full context of the windmill and in full detail. Altogether our results indicate, that although each single approach has its limitations, a combination of different imaging methods, deep learning computer vision algorithms and sophisticated visual data exploration by experienced users appears to have potential to overcome the bottleneck in data analysis, interpretation and decision making in the context of the future inspections of offshore windmills, platforms or other constructions. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The global installed capacity of floating offshore wind turbines is projected to increase by at least 100 times over the next decades. Station-keeping of floating offshore renewable energy devices is achieved through the use of mooring systems. Mooring systems are exposed to a variety of environmental and operational conditions that cause corrosion, abrasion, and fatigue. Regular physical in-service inspections of mooring systems are the golden standard for monitoring their health status. This approach is often expensive, inefficient, and unsafe, and for this reason, researchers are focusing on developing tools for digital solutions for real-time monitoring. Floating offshore renewable energy devices are usually equipped with a wide range of sensors, some low-cost, low/zero maintenance, and easily deployable (e.g., accelerometers on the tower), contrary to others (e.g., direct tension mooring line measurements), producing real-time data streams. In this paper, we propose exploiting the data coming from the first type of sensors for mooring systems health status nowcasting. In particular, we will first rely on state-of-the-art supervised shallow and deep learning models for predicting the health status of the different sections of the mooring lines. Then, since these supervised models require types and amount of data that are seldom available, we will propose new shallow and deep weekly supervised models that require a very small amount of data regarding worn mooring lines. Results will show that these last models can potentially have practical applicability and impact for real-time monitoring of mooring systems in the near future. In order to support our statements, we will make use of data generated with a state-of-the-art digital twin of the mooring system, OrcaFlex, for a floating offshore wind turbine reproducing the physical mechanism of the mooring degradation under different loads and environmental conditions. Results will show errors around 1% in the simplest scenario and errors around 4% in the most challenging one, confirming the potentiality of the proposed approaches. © 2024 The Authors},

We consider the energy efficiency, reliability, safety, and economy of OWPS from various aspects, such as offshore wind and wave energy utilization, offshore wind turbine components, and wind power operation parameters, and compare them with onshore wind power systems. We suggest that OWPS can benefit from advanced design optimization, digital twin, monitoring and forecasting, fault diagnosis, and other technologies to enhance their O&M performance.

	abstract = {The digitalization of wind power generation is rapidly progressing with the development of ICT technologies such as big data, IoT, and artificial intelligence, along with the trend of large-scale wind power generation and the expansion of offshore wind power generation. As the number of wind turbines installed in power generation complexes decreases due to the increasing size of turbines, the availability, reliability, efficiency, and lifespan of each wind turbine are becoming increasingly important. In particular, digital twin technology for high-efficiency operation is expected to accelerate due to the large-scale expansion of offshore wind power and the increase in operation and maintenance (O&M) costs resulting from the scale and aging of turbines. In this paper, we intend to establish a foundation for extending the lifespan of wind turbines through performance analysis and durability evaluation of Korean wind turbines, as well as the development of remaining life prediction technology. To predict the remaining life of a wind turbine, we selected crucial components based on failure rates and downtime, focusing on identifying the core parts of the turbine. Actual SCADA and CMS operational data for key components were acquired, and system performance was analyzed using artificial intelligence and knowledge-based condition diagnosis algorithms. The remaining life prediction program will be enhanced using real-time sensor data obtained from the following performance analysis. The final outcome will be applied to real wind turbines in Korea for a long-term demonstration. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an overview of the performance analysis techniques and instrumentation adopted for the pioneer multi-MW WindFloat Atlantic project,the first exploiting commercial-scale semi-submersible floating wind devices, is presented. Initial results and how these will be exploited for the smart operation and maintenance planning of the floating foundations are discussed. The combined approach, novel for floating wind technology, is based on the use of modern component monitoring and control instrumentation, both installed on the floating platform and on the wind turbine, coupled to data analysis and visualization techniques. The data retrieved during operation on one of the three full-scale WindFloat devices deployed at sea are analyzed to confirm the validity of numerical expectations and derive insights for future development. The outcomes of the monitoring of planar and angular motions, especially in relation to design conditions, are presented. Post-processing and elaboration of field data is used to classify relevant information, which will be used for the refinement and calibration of the predictive algorithms that in turn will enable smart analytics and controller optimization. Although this is an on-going task, these methodologies will be combined to build a tailored Digital Twin of the device. In this way, a multi-disciplinary approach leading towardspossible extension of the project lifetime, minimization of operational expenses, and an increase in energy-based availability and electricity production, will be obtained. As such, this manuscript paves the way for the digitalization of the floating wind sector, with subsequent de-risking of this novel technology and related offshore interventions. © 2022, Offshore Technology Conference.

	abstract = {Offshore wind energy is playing an increasingly vital role in the clean energy transition around the world, and improved reliability of wind turbine structures is necessary for the long-term success and efficiency of renewable energy. Increased reliability would reduce costs associated with maintenance due to breakages and in turn reduce the levelized cost of energy for offshore wind energy sources. Structural health monitoring methods can be used to predict breakages and extend lifetimes by continuously monitoring instrumented structures. This paper presents system identification and model updating of a 6 MW offshore wind turbine using vibration measurements under varying operational conditions. The turbine is monopile-supported and instrumented with strain gauges and accelerometers at several elevations along the tower and monopile. Effective stiffness of soil springs in the model are updated to match modal-predicted natural frequencies and mode shapes of the first two modes with those identified from measurements at different operating conditions. A deterministic and probabilistic (Bayesian) approach to model updating are compared. The sensitivity of identified modal parameters and the updated model parameters are investigated with respect to operational and environmental conditions such as wind speed. Results show that deterministic model updating can match modal parameters with high accuracy across datasets and environmental conditions. Bayesian model updating results successfully estimate the posterior distribution of updating model parameters with an increasing degree of certainty as more data is used. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This work is part of the DIGIFLOAT project. This project aims to provide a digital twin software framework that enables high-fidelity structural integrity analysis for a floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) in its as-is state – we refer to this as a structural digital twin (SDT). The same framework is also applicable at design time to assess an extensive range of operational conditions with high-fidelity analysis. In order to achieve this purpose, we validate in this work, a complete system-level FOWT structural analysis framework, which is integrated with NREL OpenFAST and Akselos’ Integra® software. OpenFAST provides the global motions and loads, and these are mapped in the time-domain to the structural model for structural analysis. The structural analysis includes all relevant loads from the system-level model: wind turbine aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, servo-control, and mooring. We demonstrate that the Reduced Basis Finite Element Analysis (RB-FEA) used in Integra® makes detailed structural analysis of FOWT hulls efficient, and that this is an enabler for FOWT SDTs.

	abstract = {This report reviews the recent advances of the past years in ships and offshore structural testing area including scaling laws, DIC, hydrodynamic of flexible structures, wave-in-deck, hybrid model testing, corrosion testing, iced load measurements, health monitoring model and digital twin model. The following summary and recommendations are made for future work in the area of innovative experimental methods in ships and offshore industry. It is important to also note that as experimental techniques allow for a greater understanding of the underlying material and structural behaviour, and generate extensive data clouds for processing and evaluation. As a result, we recommend that a future chapter in the next committee report focus on data evaluation and statistical approaches; this can provide an in-depth look of state of the art of processes utilized for evaluating the extensive data captured/utilized during experiments. In chapter 2, a review of scaling laws is presented in systematic and recent advancements in structural testing related to ships and offshore structures. General scale modelling methods are provided and described the main characteristics of each method such as dimensional analysis, applied to governing equation, energy method, empirical similarity method through the literature review. Recent application of scale models can be found in field of offshore wind turbine structure and ice testing area. These structures are subjected to complex phenomena such as wave loads and drifting forces may also need to be considered in particular applications, ice flows, continuous winter sea ice, and icebergs. Application DIC in chapter 3, DIC techniques have certainly come into play in many recent experimental evaluations, as the methods allows for elucidating the surface strain behaviour of a component evaluated either in the laboratory and in the field. This chapter has been to give an updated review on applications of DIC techniques in ships and offshore structural tests classifying them by test articles, with a brief insight on commercial instrumentations available on the industry and related to DIC society and a deeper focus on the applied methodologies, providing recent references for those who are interested in this topic. Worth mentioning is that some DIC applications are included in the benchmark study performed by the Committee and reported in section 15. In chapter 4, A large amount of research has focused on better measuring and predicting the hydrodynamic loads, forming several practical hydrodynamic coefficients databases which have been widely used in VIV prediction tools for flexible structure manufacturing industry. Although these databases make great contributions to the field of VIV research, have not been sufficiently modelled in the coefficient database obtained from rigid cylinder experiments. Recently, the phase angle between cross-flow and in-line response had a strong influence on the hydrodynamic coefficients for both rigid and flexible cylinders. And variations of tension and flow velocity were strongly correlated with time-varying hydrodynamic coefficients, therefore, inputs to the prediction of vessel motion induced VIVs, making the prediction possible. Also, the effects of Re numbers and surface roughness on hydrodynamics of VIV and the effect of wake interference on hydrodynamics of a twin-tube submerged floating tunnel (SFT) can be found for can efficient way and requirement in the literature. In chapter 5, based on the challenges remaining in the problem of wave-in-deck impact on offshore structures discussed above, there are several research gaps that can be addressed in future. There is still considerable uncertainty about the magnitude and distribution of wave impact loads on structural deck elements near the free-surface. Effects of the columns of the floating platform on the wave-in-deck forces have not been systematically studied. The measurement, estimation and simulation of local pressures due to wave-in-deck impact events on all types of offshore structures remains challenging. Accurate measurements and prediction of global loads and dynamic response of floating offshore structures due to wave-in-deck impact events is extremely limited. Combined numerical-experimental wave-in-deck investigations on floating offshore structures are not currently available in the open literature. In chapter 6, this chapter focused on hybrid model testing (HMT) combines physical model test and numerical simulations to solve problems that physical model tests alone cannot conveniently or reliably address. In marine model testing, the challenges like ultra-deep water, multi-phase fluids, parameter traversal and so on cannot be avoided. HMT is regarded as the most promising technique to solve these issues. As of today, HMT is still immature, some advanced applications however have been developed. HMT allows researchers to impose mass-spring-damping parameters in virtual space and can artificially adjust and precisely control these critical parameters. It is a very helpful and exciting idea to solve the involved problems. In Chapter 7, a brief reviewed of friction test in terms of two main areas exist where friction is of importance: machineries and mechanical connections, and in cargo/mechanical handling operations. For maritime and offshore applications (e.g. Out-of-Plane Bending), surface conditions and environmental conditions are important parameters. Small and the smaller specimens may be used for screening the theoretical friction coefficients and find trends. Larger or even real size specimens should be used to confirm the actual behaviour. As per the results of literature, friction tests can be split it eh standard, small size specimen standard tests, and the large size, more representative tests. While the standard tests are well covered by standards and guidelines, the larger set-ups are to be tailor made and require goo understanding of the physics as results require interpretation by the experimenter. In chapter 8, the measurement, analysis and mitigation of vibrations in ship and offshore structures is rather well established. Nevertheless, measurement and mitigation methods are still being developed. Measurement’s techniques may also include laser of video techniques. Mitigation measures include devices that cancel vibrations at a low weight penalty, such as absorbing supports or Tuned Mass Dampers. Numerical developments include methods that use sub-structuring or modal shapes to reduce the computational cost. In chapter 9, Material selection for ships and offshore structures exposed to sub-zero temperatures is traditionally based on Charpy and fracture toughness test results of the base materials and its welded connections. In the last years however, fatigue properties have been the focus of a couple of studies due to the acceleration of fatigue crack growth below the so-called fatigue transition temperature, where ductile crack growth is superimposed by cleavage burst. Concluding, fatigue testing at low temperatures demands special attention to the set-up and instrumentation. The testing temperature is normally lower than the application temperature, and liquid nitrogen may be needed to cool down the area of interest to -60 °C. Temperature compensation is required for sensor, either strain gauges or potential drop methods. In chapter 10, The corrosion process and the interpretation of the effect of corrosion on the structural integrity remains an area of uncertainty. In corrosion testing, a large spread may be observed in measured corrosion rates, as is confirmed by industrial thickness measurement. Including the geometrical effects of corrosion damage in a representative manner in numerical simulations requires the use of probabilistic methods, as a precise description would require model with too many details. Hence, simplifications and generalizations are needed. In chapter 11, large scale impact experimentation are unique options to verify developments in structures design, analysis and prediction of failure. In turn, this demands good command of the experimentation techniques, and the use of as many sensors as possible to make possible use of the results. In chapter 12, The chapter present a State-of-the-Art review, to include recent advances and future trends of industry challenge with current standard and out lookout. The wind industry is concerning with the long time-to-marked for future large turbine blades and are interested in ways to shorten the test time. It is a question at which size and when will it stop to make sense to test these long blades according to current standard. Trends of development of more advanced test methods investigated a dual or multi axis test methods to test blades under more representative loading compared to operational loads and ways to speed up the test and challenge with different SN-curves for different materials. Testing parts of blades captured testing with more complex and realistic loading at forced loading, challenges with boundaries, and using subcomponent testing to validate numerical models. In chapter 13, Full scale ice load measurements play a significant role in the design of ships and offshore structures in ice covered waters. Full scale measurements of fixed vertical offshore structure are dis-cussed here. Generalizability of the results can be summarised that as pointed out by Kärnä (2009) it is likely that the experimental data recorded on vertical structures is only applicable for the conditions where the data was record-ed. Thus, data recorded for stiff structures might not be applicable for compliant structures. As discussed before, the compliancy might be one source of the observed rate dependency. The collected data is often incomplete: although local and global ice forces can be recorded during ice action, the ice properties (compressive strength, porosity...) might remain unknown. It is because the ice samples cannot be taken during ice action - when ice is moving. Actual local pressure is challenging to measure. It is known that the ice pressure is concentrated in a small area as shown by Joensuu & Riska (1989). They observed in laboratory scale experiments using PVDF-film that the ice pressure is concentrated on narrow, line like high pressure zones. But, the area of the load panels in full scale of often quite big, in the order of 1 m2. Thus, the actual local pressure exerted to structure is significantly higher than the average pressure measured with the big load panels. But there is no method available for more accurate local pressure measurements in full scale. Although field tests are important and can reveal phenomena that cannot be observed in laboratory scale, there are few things to consider when interpreting the results. In chapter 14, Bridging the relationship between the degradation in the material and the structure is an emerging field of research which requires advanced data fusion, signal processing, AI-based trend detection algorithms and the reliability analysis methods. Data fusion herein refers to combining the data gathered from different SHM sensors by using data fusion algorithms for better damage diagnosis (Eleftheroglou et al., 2018). Other research efforts are recommended for improving the durability of SHM sensors for offshore implementations, inclusion of SHM in the condition monitoring standards and guidelines, addressing big-data issues for developing real-time data collection and analysis frameworks and using the digital twins for real-time reliability assessment. In the Benchmark study, from this relatively simple experiment performed by 6 parties, it is clear that a vast range of choices can be made to carry out the tests. Understanding the effect of the choices on the end result is essential. For instance, a heavy sensor influences the natural frequency a lot. Also, the chosen instrumentation influences the information to be gained from an experiment. Only the natural frequency, by manual excitation, or also damping and higher order modes when using an instrumented hammer. In order to understand the many experiments that are done worldwide, sharing of the results and being transparent on the methodologies of experimentation is very beneficial for making the most of any experiment. Experimental data should be published as is in digital format and not only as a by-product in a publication as figures limiting the use of it. © The Author(s), 2022.},

	abstract = {This study develops a methodology to create detailed visual Digital Twins of large-scale structures with their realistic damages detected from visual inspection or nondestructive testing. The methodology is demonstrated with a transition piece of an offshore wind turbine and a composite rotor blade, with surface paint damage and subsurface delamination damage, respectively. Artificial Intelligence and color threshold segmentation are used to classify and localize damages from optical images taken by drones. These damages are digitalized and mapped to a 3D geometry reconstruction of the large-scale structure or a CAD model of the structure. To map the images from 2D to 3D, metadata information is combined with the geo placement of the large-scale structure's 3D model. The 3D model can here both be a CAD model of the structure or a 3D reconstruction based on photogrammetry. After mapping the damage, the Digital Twin gives an accurate representation of the structure. The location, shape, and size of the damage are visible on the Digital Twin. The demonstrated methodology can be applied to industrial sectors such as wind energy, the oil and gas industry, marine and aerospace to facilitate asset management. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {During the recent research studies Digital Twin (DT) simulation models for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) based on data-driven mode have been developed, which can provide accurate simulation and prediction of mooring forces of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWTs). However, the performance of this kind modelling is highly affected by the quantity of real data training set and it is limited to some specific configuration and the recorded environmental conditions. More importantly, the data-driven DT cannot interpret the physical meaning of structural dynamic interactions. Therefore, a new Physics-Based estimator is proposed in this work. The fully coupled FOWT simulations are carried out in QBlade Ocean and the simulation results are used to prepare the Reduced-Order Model by system identification for different sea states. The proposed estimator is based on the Augmented Kalman Filter in which the unknown mooring force is augmented as a state. The prediction of state is adjusted with the measurable platform motion data. It demonstrates the ability of filtering the noise in measurements and capturing the dynamic behaviour of FOWT with acceptable low computational cost. This real-time state estimator also provides the foundation of developing the DT modelling framework of FOWT and enables us to scale-up FOWTs in the next stage. Copyright © 2023 by ASME.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for enhancing frequency-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of Offshore Wind Turbines (OWTs) by incorporating digital twin models. The proposed methodology utilizes an automated operational modal analysis to extract modal frequencies from acceleration measurements. The environmental and operational variability is removed through tree-based regression models, which can adequately recognize the different operational states of the OWT. The proposed data-driven approach relies on the detection of the modal frequency changes caused by a damaging scenario in the OWT (e.g. scouring). The digital twin model accounts for the actual properties of the substructure, considering the specific foundation geometry and soil conditions at the monitored OWT location. A statistical control chart is used to identify the possible scour depth by comparing the changes in the normalized modal frequency and the digital-twin calculations. The methodology is demonstrated on 4 months of measurements from a full-scale monitored OWT. The proposed methodology advances the SHM capabilities from damage detection to damage quantification, enabling improved operations & maintenance strategies for OWTs. © 2023 by DEStech Publi cations, Inc.

	abstract = {In this study, a vibration-based fault detection method is proposed for offshore wind turbine drivetrain based on the optimal selection of the acceleration measurements. The main aim is to find the sensor positions mounted on the drivetrain that provides the most fault-related information. In fact, this study tries to optimize the vibration sensors suggested by ISO standards in terms of their position and number in order to get accurate fault detection results. The faults are considered in a set of bearings with a high probability of failure in a 5-MW reference drivetrain high-fidelity model installed on a spar-type floating wind turbine. Different simulated shaft acceleration measurements are examined under three environmental conditions. Correlation analysis is first performed on the measurements to see how the different faults and environmental conditions affect the correlation between the measurements. Then, a combined principal component analysis (PCA) and convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed as the fault detection method through the optimal vibration measurements. The prediction findings demonstrate that only two vibration sensors, one near the main shaft and another near the intermediate-speed shaft, can fully detect the considered faulty bearings. Also, it will be shown that the axial vibration data give more promising results than the radial ones which can be used in virtual digital twin models. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWT) can be actively controlled to minimize their wave induced motions, improving wind energy harvesting efficiency and increasing structural life by reducing fatigue loads. Here, we report on the development and validation of Wave Reconstruction and Prediction (WRP) algorithms that improve the active control of floating structure motions, achieved, e.g., by moving mass or ballast. Specifically, given a sensing method, here assumed to be LiDAR-like, that acquires dense spatiotemporal surface elevation data at some distance from the FOWT in the incident wave direction, we present and validate deterministic WRP algorithms, based on fast nonlinear and dispersive Lagrangian wave models, and integrate their predictions with in-the-loop hardware and a real time control system that is informed by computations with a digital twin (DT) model of the floating structure. We implement multiple WRP wave models including a model based on linear wave theory (LWT) with a correct dispersion accounting for nonlinearity (LWT-CDR) and a 2nd-order “Choppy” wave model with improved nonlinear dispersive properties (ICWM), initialized with a linear prediction. Although we run laboratory experiments of the complete system, which are reported elsewhere, here the WRP implementation is validated against fully nonlinear potential flow simulations in a Numerical Wave Tank (NWT), which shows both LWT-CDR and ICWM models appear to provide reasonable short-term predictions at the float. Implications for the real time control system are discussed; in a companion paper, the use of short-term wave predictions with the WRP is shown to improve the real time control of float motions in waves. © 2023 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).},

Utilizing a Digital Twin framework the virtual sensor combines data from readily available sensors of the condition monitoring (CMS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system with a physics-based gearbox model. Different state estimation methods including Kalman filter, Least-square estimator, and a quasi-static approach are employed for load estimation. For RUL assessment the accumulated fatigue damage is calculated with the Palmgren–Miner model. A case study using simulation measurements from a high-fidelity gearbox model is conducted to evaluate the proposed method. Estimated loads at the considered intermediate and high-speed shaft bearings show moderate to high correlation (R = 0.50 - 0.96) to measurements, as lower frequency internal dynamics are not fully captured. The estimated fatigue damage differs by 5–15% from measurements. Copyright © 2022 by ASME.},

Analysing the existing scholarly literature, the review encompasses insights into the historical reliability landscape, DT deployment methodologies, and their influence on FOWT structures. Findings underscore the pivotal role of DT technology in enhancing FOWT reliability through real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance strategies, resulting in improved operational efficiency and reduced downtime. Highlighting the significance of DT technology as a potent mechanism for fortifying FOWT reliability, the review emphasises its potential to foster a robust operational framework while acknowledging the necessity for continued research to address technical intricacies and regulatory considerations in its integration within offshore wind energy systems.

	abstract = {Surrogate models are vital for offshore wind farm optimisation, or digital twin for rapid execution. Reliable surrogates are difficult to make, especially for large wind farms and for fatigue loads. One limitation is the high resolution of turbulence needed for fatigue calculations and the vast size of a wind farm. We present code optimisations for implementing the Mann model for farm-sized flows, which are infeasible otherwise. Additionally, we present a case study of a full load surrogate for the Lillgrund offshore wind farm using large turbulence box generation in aeroelastic wind farm simulations using HAWC2Farm. Various mappings between the wind field in front of a turbine and the corresponding turbine structural fatigue loads are presented. The best-performing surrogate model, using a proper orthogonal decomposition of the input space with an artificial neural network, is able to significantly reduce the error in fatigue load estimates by as much as a factor of 5 compared to conventional methods. The presented recommendations are crucial to generating reliable wind farm load surrogates for wind farm optimisation purposes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In this work, we explain the digital twin concept and the capability level scale in the context of wind energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate a standalone digital twin, a descriptive digital twin, and a prescriptive digital twin of an operational floating offshore wind turbine. The standalone digital twin consists of the virtual representation of the wind turbine and its operating environment. While at this level the digital twin does not evolve with the physical turbine, it can be used during the planning-, design-, and construction phases. At the next level, the descriptive digital twin is built upon the standalone digital twin by enhancing the latter with real data from the turbine. All the data is visualized in virtual reality for informed decision-making. Besides being used for data bundling and visualization, the descriptive digital twin forms the basis for diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive, and autonomous tools. A predictive digital twin is created through the use of weather forecasts, neural networks, and transfer learning. Finally, digital twin technology is discussed in a much wider context of ocean engineering. Copyright © 2023 by ASME.},

	abstract = {A response-based time domain structural analysis method for offshore floating platforms has been studied and validated. Compared to the conventional load-based and simplified method, the response base method can evaluate structural strength and fatigue damage with higher accuracy, taking into account irregular waves, non-linear environmental loadings, phasing between different loads, non-linear motion responses, and non-linear mooring and riser loadings. The present study examines the structural assessment of the entire substructure and the turbine tower to substructure connection of a Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT) platform using a response-based time domain structural analysis. Finite Element (FE) models are constructed for the entire FOWT, and corresponding load components are mapped to the FE model. A fully coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic analysis software, MLTSIM-OpenFAST, is used to calculate dynamic responses of a FOWT in the time domain. and used for the life cycle response analysis of a FOWT with 25 years of weather data. All load components are synthesized at every instantaneous time step and converted to response-based stresses. This methodology efficiently and more accurately determines the stress distribution for different load cases which is useful for both new design and digital twin for integrity management to provide quick structural strength and fatigue damage assessment.

	abstract = {In the present study, a structural health monitoring (SHM) method for floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) is suggested and tested using operational modal analysis (OMA) with numerical-sensor signals. The numerical accelerometer signals along the tower and blade of FOWT in dynamic wind field are used for the OMA. The numerical-sensor signals are simulated using a time-domain turbine-floater-mooring fully-coupled dynamic simulation computer program. To perform the SHM of a FOWT through OMA, natural frequencies, displacement mode shapes (DMS), and curvature mode shapes (CMS) of the tower and blades are obtained and analyzed. The modal properties are systematically compared between the intact and damaged conditions. Their differences are used for damage detection. The results show that CMS is found to be the most effective modal property to detect damage locations and intensities. The performance of the damage detection based on the OMA-CMS analysis is verified by independent FEM (finite element method) results. This study is unique in that the SHM using OMA and CMS for FOWTs is implemented including the floater-tower-blade coupling effects. The technology can contribute to the design of remote SHM system for future FOWTs. A further validated model with field data may build up a huge database for various damage scenarios so that it can be applied to digital-twin-based smart health monitoring technology. © 2019},

	abstract = {In the wind energy industry, a digital twin (DT) is very useful for managing the operation of a wind turbine and predicting structural health conditions in real-time as well as projections in the near future. A real-time surrogate model is a very crucial part in building a DT. Towards that end, we employ a Reduced-Order Modelling (ROM) approach to construct a surrogate model for the environment-structure system of a bottom-fixed offshore wind turbine (OWT). The entire environment-structure system is broken down into major sub-systems of wind, wave, and structure. Based on the high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data, the wind ROM model can quickly provide the loadings on the components above water level in the parameter space spanned by the incoming wind speed, the rotational speed of the rotor, the pitch and tilt angles of the turbine. The hydro loadings on the underwater components of the OWT are solved by the empirical Morison formula. The OWT structural ROM model is component-based consisting of blades, hub, nacelle, tower, and monopile. The structural ROM model takes the loading data feeds from the wind and wave models to predict the structure responses of the OWT system, including stress. Since the DT is constructed via the component-based, it can also be used to play out “what if” scenarios when there are component level changes. For instance, the model can predict the system response of OWT when certain parts undergo structure failures. Benefiting from the cost-efficient ROM models, the DT is over two orders of magnitude faster than high-fidelity simulations while maintaining good accuracy. Copyright © 2023 by ASME.},

	abstract = {The coupled action of wind and wave on the stability of floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) tremendously affects the lifespan of these energy systems and their energy output. Passive control systems reduce such loads but can only mitigate the loading over a small range of excitation frequencies. To improve this, an active control system (ACS) is needed. The aim of this research is a digital twin proof of concept allowing the diagnosis of current and upcoming environmental events and re-tuning the ACS based on a tuned mass dampers system (TMD) to minimize wave-induced response at the frequency range of interest. This is accomplished through a series of numerical investigations supported by laboratory measurements in a wave basin made on a scale model of a 15MW FOWT. The numerical models are implemented via the multi-physics, multi-fidelity code: OpenFAST, that enables coupled nonlinear aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulation in time domain. The code is modified to enable ACS implementation and ease of communication between the controller and OpenFAST. After validating the model, an open-loop controller is designed to allow multiple stiffness and damping entries targeting first-order wave-frequency region. Two methods of data acquisition are investigated: the Current Sea-State Controller (CSSC) where sea-state prediction is governed by past wave elevation data points using a polynomial weighted buffer that leverages more recent data, and the Future Sea-State Controller (FSSC) that, additionally utilizes recon-struction/prediction model of the upcoming wave to investigate the effect of reduced latency in the controller response. Both controllers are optimized through a genetic algorithm scheme. Results show reduction in wave excitations ranging between 10s to 20s under varying sea-state when future wave elevation data is fed to the controller. © 2023 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).},

	abstract = {Digital twins (DTs) are thought to be promising tools for offshore wind turbines (OWTs) in real-time updating, optimized design, intelligent operation, and maintenance. When creating DT analysis tools, it is critical to update model parameters to create high-fidelity, high-accuracy virtual models. In this paper, a Bayesian updating framework based on Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC) is proposed to construct the desired virtual model of monopile OWTs to address this difficult problem. The likelihood function for Bayesian inference was created using measurements from physical entity monitoring as well as natural frequencies and damping ratios from the monopile OWT finite element (FE) model. Then, through a series of relatively simple intermediate likelihood functions, it gradually converges to the target function. During this time, the artificial neural network (ANN) surrogate model calculates the intermediate likelihood function of each sample, and a parallel computing strategy is used to enhance the computational efficiency. The results show that the posterior distribution of the uncertain parameters can be successfully estimated from the Markov chain using this method to update the finite element model. In addition, the proposed Bayesian updating method is resistant to measurement noise. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Over the course of the last four decades, the rotor diameter of Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWTs) has undergone a substantial increase, expanding from 15 m (30 kW) to an impressive 240 m (15MW), primarily aimed at enhancing their power generation capacity. This growth in blade swept area, however, gives rise to heightened loads, stresses and deflections, imposing more rigorous demands on the structural robustness of these components. To prevent sudden failure and to plan effective inspection, maintenance, and repair activities, it is vital to estimate the reliability of the rotor blades by considering all the forces (aerodynamic and structural dynamics) acting on them over the turbine's lifespan. This research proposes a comprehensive methodology that seamlessly combines fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulation, Kriging model/algorithm and Adaptive Kriging Monte Carlo Simulation (AKMCS) to assess the reliability of the HAWT rotor blades. Firstly, high-fidelity FSI simulations are performed to investigate the dynamic response of the rotor blade under varying wind conditions. Recognizing the computationally intensive nature and time-consuming aspects of FSI simulations, a judicious approach involves harnessing an economical Kriging model as a surrogate. This surrogate model adeptly predicts blade deflection along its length, utilizing training and testing data derived from FSI simulations. Impressively, the Kriging model predicts blade deflection 400 times faster than the FSI simulations, showcasing its enhanced efficiency. The optimized surrogate model is then used to estimate the flap wise blade tip deflection for one million wind speed samples generated using Weibull distribution. Thereafter, to evaluate the reliability of the blades, statistical modeling using methods such as Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS), AKMCS is performed. The results demonstrate the faster convergence of AKMCS requiring only 21 samples, as opposed to 1 million samples for MCS with minimal reduction in the precision of the estimated probability of failure (Pf) and reliability index (β). Demonstrated on the backdrop of an IEA-15MW offshore reference WT rotor blade, the proposed methodology underscores its potential to be seamlessly incorporated into the creation of WT digital twins, due to its near real-time predictive capabilities for Pf and β assessments. © 2023},

	abstract = {Due to the adverse impact of the offshore environment, the cost of on-site monitoring, operation and maintenance of offshore wind turbines is greatly increased. Here, a digital twin (DT) method based on digital model and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation database is proposed, which is used to rapidly predict and synchronously display the distribution of the wake field, structural deformation and stress of fixed OWTs. First, a large number of data have been calculated by using CFD method. Second, the three-dimensional finite element model is reduced to a digital model by the proper orthogonal decomposition method, all data is stored in a multi-source heterogeneous database. Furthermore, the anisotropic inverse distance weighted interpolation and particle swarm optimization algorithm methods are used to obtain uncalculated data results and supplement database. Then the Bayesian regularization-back propagation neural network method is developed to correct the data with large errors. The results show that the learning error of the flow field and structural strength is less than 10% and 4% compared with the CFD method, respectively. This study could provide a rapid monitoring engineering reference for the safety assessment of turbine flow field distribution and structural strength. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) has been recognized as a useful tool for safety management and risk reduction of offshore wind farms. In complex offshore environment, jacket structures of offshore wind turbines are prone to damages due to corrosion and fatigue. Effective SHM on jacket structures can substantially reduce their operation risk and costs. This work reviews the latest progress on the SHM of offshore wind jacket structures. The achievements in the structural damage identification, location, quantification, and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation are respectively introduced in detail, and existing challenges are discussed. Possible solutions to the challenges using the Digital Twin (DT) technology are put forward. The DT is able to mirror a real jacket structure into a virtual model, and Bayesian updating can refresh the virtual model parameters in real-time to keep consistency between virtual model and physical structure; then, just-in-time SHM can be carried out for jacket structures by performing damage detection, location, quantification, and RUL estimation using the virtual model. As a result, the DT may provide engineers and researchers a practicable tool for safety monitoring and risk reduction of fixed foundation offshore wind structures. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Offshore wind turbines are complex systems operating in harsh environment. The dynamic demands in these systems often differ from values used in design, leading to unexpected mechanical and structural failures. This signifies the importance of remote monitoring technologies for damage diagnosis and prognosis in offshore wind turbines. This study is focused on developing mechanics-based digital twins for offshore wind turbine monitoring through a model-updating process using sparse measurement data. Digital twins can be used to estimate the system unmeasured response (i.e., virtual sensing) and to predict the remaining useful fatigue life and failure point of different structural components. A time-domain sequential Bayesian finite element model updating is proposed for mechanics-based digital twinning. This approach is formulated for application to offshore wind turbine and jointly estimates the updating model parameters and the time history of unknown input forces. A classical modal-based model updating followed by modal expansion method is also implemented for comparison. In this approach, updating model parameters are estimated to minimize the discrepancies between the identified and model-predicted modal parameters of the turbine. The performance of these two approaches are studied on a 2-MW offshore wind turbine at the Blyth wind farm in the United Kingdom. Strain response time history at mudline is estimated through both approaches and compared with actual measurements for validation. It is observed that both approaches are capable of accurate response prediction while the Bayesian approach leads to slightly better results. Furthermore, the Bayesian approach allows for identification of input loads and uncertainty quantification. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Efficient operation of mooring systems is of paramount importance to reduce floating offshore wind (FOW) energy costs. MooringSense is an R&D project which explores digitization to enable the implementation of more efficient integrity management strategies (IMS) for FOW mooring systems. In this work, the MooringSense concept is presented. It includes the development of several enablers such as a mooring system digital twin, a smart motion sensor, a structural health monitoring (SHM) system and control strategies at the individual turbine and farm levels. The core of the digital twin (DT) is a high-fidelity fully coupled numerical model which integrates simulation tools to allow predictive operation and maintenance (O&M). Relevant parameters of the coupled model are updated as physical properties evolve due to damages or degradation. The DT assimilates information coming from the physical asset and environmental sensors. Besides, a smart motion sensor provides feedback of the attitude, position, and velocity of the floater to allow the computation of virtual loads in the mooring lines, the detection of damages by the SHM system and the implementation of closed-loop control strategies. Finally, the IMS takes advantage of the mooring system updated condition information to optimize O&M, reduce costs and increase energy production. Copyright © 2021 by ASME},

	abstract = {As the Floating Offshore Wind Turbine industry approaches the transition from demonstrators to commercial scale farms, condition monitoring systems will be integral to risk management. Scalable condition monitoring solutions exist for both Fixed Offshore Wind and floating Oil and Gas, however a holistic solution addressing aerodynamic and hydrodynamic challenges on a floating wind unit is lacking. Where sensors should be minimized, or for unmeasurable parameters, digital twins offer an alternative for predicting major component condition, relying instead on numerical models based on floater global response and metocean conditions. This paper demonstrates the potential of reconstructed load signals, state-of-the-art sensors and first principles physics-based digital twins using approaches from the Wind and Oil and Gas sectors. Existing motion-based integrity monitoring methods are adapted to a real-time reduced-order model of a floating wind unit. Specifically, a state-observer model is used to reproduce position and mooring tension, enabling mooring failure identification and fatigue tracking. The methods are demonstrated through a 15 MW synthetic case study, including examination of the impact of noise and sensor loss on reliability. The results show that the integration of digital twins into sensor-based monitoring systems can reconstruct missing data with sufficient certainty to facilitate early detection of failures.

	abstract = {The development of offshore wind farms around the world is increasing significantly due to the need to decarbonize electrical energy systems. The implementation of wind turbines with permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) in these wind farms is remarkable. Since wind turbines become more powerful every year, it is important to improve maintenance plans and to prevent failures in order to keep reduce downtime. In the case of offshore wind turbines, the logistics required to carry out repairs considerably increase the operating costs. This way, it is important to develop strategies that reduce operation and maintenance costs and increase the lifetime of the equipment.This work was developed to analyze the main failures that occur in PMSG-based offshore wind turbines, and the state of the art regarding failure modeling and simulation. The most common and critical faults of the PMSG-based wind turbines have been considered, which are usually in the power converter and in the electric generator. The objective is to integrate the analysis into a model of an offshore wind turbine and to develop a working digital twin. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this work, we implement, verify, and validate a physics-based digital twin solution applied to a floating offshore wind turbine. The digital twin is validated using measurement data from the full-scale TetraSpar prototype. We focus on the estimation of the aerodynamic loads, wind speed, and section loads along the tower, with the aim of estimating the fatigue lifetime of the tower. Our digital twin solution integrates (1) a Kalman filter to estimate the structural states based on a linear model of the structure and measurements from the turbine, (2) an aerodynamic estimator, and (3) a physics-based virtual sensing procedure to obtain the loads along the tower. The digital twin relies on a set of measurements that are expected to be available on any existing wind turbine (power, pitch, rotor speed, and tower acceleration) and motion sensors that are likely to be standard measurements for a floating platform (inclinometers and GPS sensors). We explore two different pathways to obtain physics-based models: A suite of dedicated Python tools implemented as part of this work and the OpenFAST linearization feature. In our final version of the digital twin, we use components from both approaches. We perform different numerical experiments to verify the individual models of the digital twin. In this simulation realm, we obtain estimated damage equivalent loads of the tower fore-Aft bending moment with an accuracy of approximately 5% to 10%. When comparing the digital twin estimations with the measurements from the TetraSpar prototype, the errors increased to 10%-15% on average. Overall, the accuracy of the results is promising and demonstrates the possibility of using digital twin solutions to estimate fatigue loads on floating offshore wind turbines. A natural continuation of this work would be to implement the monitoring and diagnostics aspect of the digital twin to inform operation and maintenance decisions. The digital twin solution is provided with examples as part of an open-source repository. © 2024 Copernicus GmbH. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Being structures that are highly sensitive to dynamic loads, Offshore Wind Turbines (OWTs) are designed to preclude any sort of resonance. However, during operation, OWTs have been known to experience modal property changes, especially, fundamental natural frequencies, which, once close to the forcing frequencies, can lead to resonance. To avoid this, these structures need to be constantly monitored to assess these modal property changes before they lead to failure. In this study, a digital twin-like model updating is carried out on a laboratory OWT (LOWT) to detect the change(s) in its soil stiffness, occasioned by the application of cyclic loads. To reduce the number of updating parameters, a few-parameters soil-structure interaction (SSI) model is incorporated into the finite element (FE) model of the LOWT, which is created in the commercial software, ANSYS. Two sets of sensing data which are acquired from the prototype LOWT are used for the model updating of the FE model in two respective stages: first, calibration in the original state; and second, update after the application of cyclic loading. For the two updates, the FE model mirrored the conditions of the prototype, based on the modal properties comparison from both, thereby, enabling successful monitoring of the soil stiffness conditions of the LOWT. The results show that soil stiffness increase with the increase in the application of cyclic loading and that the few-parameters SSI model has a high sensitivity to soil stiffness changes. The proposed methodology holds great potential as a model updating system, which draws closer to achieving the digital twin (DT) technology deployment in the monitoring of OWT foundations, and demonstrates the usefulness of a reduced-order SSI model for OWT model updating. © 2021 International Conference on Structural Health Monitoring of Intelligent Infrastructure: Transferring Research into Practice, SHMII.

In particular, the information obtained from digital twins is used to quantify and update the uncertainties associated with the structural dynamics and load modeling parameters in fatigue damage accumulation. The updated uncertainties are included in a probabilistic model for fatigue damage accumulation used to update the structural reliability. The updated reliability can be used as input to optimize decision models for operation and maintenance of existing structures and design of new structures. The framework is exemplified based on two numerical case studies with a representative offshore wind turbine and information acquired from previously established digital twins. In this context, the effect of updating soil stiffness and wave loading, which constitute two highly uncertain and sensitive parameters, is investigated. It is found that updating the soil stiffness significantly affects the reliability of the joints close to the mudline, while updating the wave loading significantly affects the reliability of the joints localized in the splash zone. The increased uncertainty related to virtual sensing, which is employed to update wave loading, reduces structural reliability. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a recursive Bayesian inference framework for digital twinning of an offshore wind turbine (OWT) in the Block Island Wind Farm (BIWF), the first commercial offshore wind farm in the U.S. with jacket substructure. The framework employs a window-based extended Kalman filter (EKF) to jointly estimate the dynamic input loads and unknown model parameters of the finite element (FE) model of the turbine using sparse output-only measurements. The estimation of input loads on the OWT is critical for fatigue life estimation, foundation monitoring and control strategy. In the proposed joint estimation algorithm, unknown input time histories are divided into overlapping windows and the current window of inputs is concatenated with uncertain model parameters to form an augmented state vector. To account for the uncertainty about wind direction and misalignment between wind direction and the turbine yaw angle, two independent horizontal wind load time histories in X and Y directions are estimated at the nacelle level. A numerical validation study is first performed in which wind loads of the OWT are simulated using the multi-physics platform FAST, and structural vibration responses are generated using the FE model in OpenSees. The window-based EKF is implemented using the simulated measurements, and the estimations of structural stiffness as the updating model parameter and input loads are observed to have high accuracy. The proposed algorithm is then validated using in-situ measurements on one of the OWT in BIWF. To investigate the effectiveness and robustness of the method under different environmental and operational conditions, four cases are considered in which the turbine is operating at the rated rotor speed (region 3 of power generation), below the rated rotor speed (region 2), idling rotor state (region 1 or no power), and region 4 beyond cut-out wind speed. Accurate predictions of acceleration and strain data are obtained using the proposed algorithm, and the estimations of model parameter are consistent and close to their nominal value under different conditions. These results from numerical and experimental studies validate the proposed window-based EKF for joint parameter-input estimation and digital twinning for long-term structural health monitoring of the OWT. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Offshore wind farms play a decisive role in the exit from fossil-fuel energy in Germany. These offshore wind turbines are oftentimes installed with jack-up vessels. At the site of operation these vessels lift their hull above the water surface by extending their jacking legs. The vessel’s seaway-induced motions at the moment of initial contact between leg and seabed define the critical dynamic structural loads onto the legs and the jacking mechanism, which have to be minimised. Therefore, an analysis of the seakeeping behaviour during the sensitive jacking sequence is required in the early design stage in order to define the vessel’s operational limits of sea state. The ship design environment E4 is an open software framework, being developed by the Institute of Ship Design and Ship Safety, which provides various methods for the dynamic analysis of a digital twin of the actual ship. However, these methods are restricted to conventional ship-type structures whereas the analysis of the seakeeping behaviour during the jack-up process further requires a consideration of the jacking legs’ hydrodynamic influence. For a holistic analysis of the seakeeping behaviour, the forces onto the legs were thus accounted for by a Morison approach in the calculation of the required response amplitude operators. This paper presents the calculation of the vessel’s seakeeping behaviour in irregular waves in time domain on the basis of these modified RAOs. The applied method calculates the vessel’s response motions in six degrees of freedom. Since the roll motion tends to show the largest response amplitudes in a seaway this degree of freedom is calculated in a non-linear way with respect to the wave amplitude and the roll angle by solving its equation of motion. The motions in the residual degrees of freedom are calculated from the underlying linear response amplitude operators. The achieved results are validated by model tests of a jack-up vessel with extended legs in irregular long-crested waves. This extended method represents a quick computational tool for early design applications in order to determine limiting sea states for the jacking sequence, which is a major design aspect of such ships. © 2020 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).},

As soil conditions and water depths are rarely uniform across a wind farm site, each structure is expected to behave differently. To back-analyse structural performance, geotechnical and structural data needs to be retrieved at every foundation location. A serverless cloud-based application was developed to allow quick and reliable storage and retrieval of geotechnical and structural data. The database was combined with an API layer to allow parametric data retrieval for back-analyses and digital twin updating across an entire wind farm. As the web application is hosted in the cloud, the data can be accessed through simple HTTP requests by authenticated users working offshore, in the office or remote. The performance of this solution is illustrated with a case study in which foundation stiffness across an entire wind farm site is parametrically calculated and updated. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Operations and installation on offshore wind and especially floating are complex and difficult actions due to site accessibility and equipment availability. In this regard, digitalization is disrupting the wind section thanks to the development of advanced sensors, automated equipment, computational power, among other. All these allow to optimize and simplify different parts of the offshore wind power plant development (i.e. design, planning, installation, O&M, etc.). This fact is of special interest on maintenance, since the early detection of failures or malfunctions lead to reduced costly corrective maintenance. This paper presents a literature review of current state-of-the-art on the application of digitalization activities which can be applied for floating wind, including typical component failures, monitoring techniques and advanced digital tools as Digital Twin concept and Building Information Models (BIM). Finally, the review paper provides an analysis of existing gaps, needs and challenges of the sector to provide guides on research and innovation to foster offshore wind sector. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Global wind energy has developed rapidly in recent years, and the offshore wind turbines (OWTs) have been applied to much more applications. Because the support structure of an OWT is prone to damage, it is crucial to strengthen the structural reliability to prevent unexpected failures and reduce operation costs by performing fault diagnosis, remaining useful life prediction, and condition-based maintenance. Through real-time monitoring on the operating status of the OWT support structures, the operation measurements can be obtained to detect initial structural cracks and predict the crack propagation to assess potential risks and perform just-in-time maintenance; as a result, the turbine downtime and maintenance costs can be significantly reduced and the wind turbine service life can be prolonged. This paper introduces the latest progress on the reliability analysis of the OWT support structures. First of all, the types of the support structures are reviewed; then, the reliability research progress on the support structure is presented and the existing challenges are discussed. In light of the digital twin (DT) technology, a solution to existing challenging issues is proposed by introducing the DT into the OWT support structures. This new DT framework will enable real-time monitoring, fault diagnosis and operation optimization of the OWT support structures, which may provide a useful application prospect in the reliability analysis of the OWT support structures in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The spatiotemporal flow field in a wind farm determines the wind turbines’ energy production and structural fatigue. However, it is not obtainable by the current measurement, modeling, and prediction tools in wind industry. Here we propose a novel data and knowledge fusion approach to create the first digital twin for onshore/offshore wind farm flow system, which can predict the in situ spatiotemporal wind field covering the entire wind farm. The digital twin is developed by integrating the Lidar measurements, the Navier–Stokes equations, and the turbine modeling using actuator disk method, via physics-informed neural networks. The design enables the seamless integration of Lidar measurements and turbine operating data for real-time flow characterization, and the fusion of flow physics for retrieving unmeasured wind field information. It thus addresses the limitations of existing wind prediction approaches based on supervised machine learning, which cannot achieve such prediction because the training targets are not available. Case studies of a wind farm under typical operating scenarios (i.e. a greedy case, a wake-steering case, and a partially-operating case) are carried out using high-fidelity numerical experiments, and the results show that the developed digital twin achieves very accurate mirroring of the physical wind farm, capturing detailed flow features such as wake interaction and wake meandering. The prediction error for the flow fields, on average, is just 4.7% of the value range. With the accurate flow field information predicted, the digital twin is expected to enable brand new research across wind farm lifecycle including monitoring, control, and load assessment. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Floating offshore structures, which are subject to wave-induced motions, are used in a wide range of ocean engineering applications, from vessels of various sizes, to oil and gas platforms (TLPs, simply tethered, . . . ), and more recently, floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) design concepts. To optimize a variety of design and operational factors, it is important to minimize these wave-induced motions, which in some cases may require using semi-or fully-active methods that may use phase-resolved information about incoming waves. In the latter case, a mass or water ballast can be actuated or moved by a pump to counteract effects of the waveinduced forces and moments on the float, on the basis of some control law. Here we present the development and experimental validation of a control system based on real-time simulations of the wave-induced motions of a floating object, with its active control method, using a complete physics-based model, referred to as a digital twin (DT). For demonstration and validation, the system is applied to a barge-like float, for which a 1:19.22 scale model is tested in a laboratory wave tank (30 m long, 3.6 m wide and 1.8 m deep) in our facilities, while being placed transverse to the tank axis, in regular or irregular waves. The float is equipped with a nonlinear model predictive controller based on a mass moving horizontally on a slider in the barge’s beam direction to control its rolling motion, actuated by a linear motor. The controller is actuated based on the DT modeling of float heave and roll including the effect of the moving mass, informed by the assimilation of past float motions and, optionally, using phase-resolved wave data at the float (either measured or predicted based on a separate model) incorporating disturbance previewing in the controller. In the experiments, the complete system is implemented and run in realtime on a desktop computer. Results will be presented and discussed, showing a significant reduction in float motions when the active control method is used. Considerations for using a similar concept to control FOWT motions will be presented as well as the potential for using open source software (OpenFAST) as a real time DT. © 2023 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).},

	abstract = {This paper highlights technical and practical challenges that the authors have faced to create a digital twin (DT) of a piece of manufacturing system, that is production process (i.e., assembly process) to serve system responsiveness (i.e., agility) in an offshore wind turbine manufacturing. It discusses the elements and architectural parameters in development of an agile manufacturing system, where DT of shopfloor and its practical setup is seen as a design element enabling agility in an industrial system. Currently, there is no detailed framework to describe how industries can practically benefit a DT of their production process in a way that their manufacturing systems becomes responsive to perturbations, and ultimately agile. More importantly, there is no detailed study to show potential challenges and their implications during deployment of such a DT. In absence of such a study, this paper proposes a configuration and practical architecture, customized for Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy’s (SGRE’s) offshore wind turbine (OWT) manufacturing system, that denotes the logic behind such framework for reuse of DT in any typical manufacturing system along with its practical implications, helping other industries to predict potential challenges and estimate realistically the required budget for such implementation. The proposed model-based structure is built up based on the benchmark commonalities and differences of the known developed DT models in manufacturing and production context, incorporating the existing physical and virtual spaces in SGRE’s OWT manufacturing system, complemented by supplementary systems and software applications from existing technologies in market. The paper concludes with thoughts on a pilot project in production line of an OWT’s generator unit that is under development to verify such a design. © ECMS Enrico Vicario, Romeo Bandinelli, Virginia Fani, Michele Mastroianni (Editors) 2023.},

	abstract = {Monitoring a wind turbine requires intensive instrumentation, which would be too cost-prohibitive to deploy to an entire wind plant. This work presents a technique that uses readily available measurements to estimate signals that would otherwise require additional instrumentation. This study presents a digital twin concept with a focus on estimating wind speed, thrust, torque, tower-top position, and loads in the tower using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) measurements. The model combines a linear state-space model obtained using OpenFAST linearizations, a wind speed estimator, and a Kalman filter algorithm that integrates measurements with the state model to perform state estimations. The measurements are: top acceleration, generator torque, pitch, and rotational speed. The article extends previous work that derived the linear state-space model using a different method. The new implementation, based on OpenFAST linearization capability, allows for a systematic extension of the method to more states, inputs, outputs, and to the offshore environment. Results from the two methods are compared, and the validation is made with additional measurements using the GE 1.5-MW turbine located at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory test site. Real-time damage equivalent loads of the tower bottom moment are estimated with an average accuracy of approximately 10%. Overall, the results from this proof of concept are encouraging, and further application of the model will be considered. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {In the wind energy industry, a cost-benefit digital twin (DT) will be very useful for managing the operation of a wind turbine. For instance, a DT could provide information on structural health conditions in real-time as well as projections for the near future. In this work, we employ a component-based Reduced-Order Modelling (ROM) technique to construct a DT of a parameter-varying offshore wind turbine system on a monopile. The DT consists of a ROM model for modal analysis and structural response prediction under wind and wave loadings. First, an offline library is pre-computed, which contains a series of component archetypes. Then, the component-based ROM is assembled out of these archetypes, such as the parts in the blade, hub, nacelle, and tower. With the computation speed of two orders (approximately 650x) faster than a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model and high accuracy (less than 0.2% error), the DT could be able to provide almost instant predictions of the modes and the responses of the turbine structure due to the wind-wave loading as well as projections of structural health conditions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The present paper provides a model updating application study concerning the jacket substructure of an offshore wind turbine. The updating is resolved in a sensitivity-based parameter estimation setting, where a cost function expressing the discrepancy between experimentally obtained modal parameters and model-predicted ones is minimized. The modal parameters of the physical system are estimated through stochastic subspace identification (SSI) applied to vibration data captured for idling and operational states of the turbine. From a theoretical outset, the identification approach relies on the system being linear and time-invariant (LTI) and the input white noise random processes; criteria which are violated in this application due to sources such as operational variability, the turbine controller, and non-linear damping. Consequently, particular attention is given to assess the feasibility of extracting modal parameters through SSI under the prevailing conditions and subsequently using these parameters for model updating. On this basis, it is deemed necessary to disregard the operational turbine states—which severely promote non-linear and time-variant structural behaviour and, as such, imprecise parameter estimation results—and conduct the model updating based on modal parameters extracted solely from the idling state. The uncertainties associated with the modal parameter estimates and the model parameters to be updated are outlined and included in the updating procedure using weighting matrices in the sensitivity-based formulation. By conducting the model updating based on in-situ data harvested from the jacket substructure during idling conditions, the maximum eigenfrequency deviation between the experimental estimates and the model-predicted ones is reduced from 30% to 1%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Vibration-based load reconstruction at support structures of offshore wind turbines. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of the tower and foundation structures of offshore wind turbines is an established and acknowledged technical rule in engineering practice. The acquisition, assessment and analysis of the acting fatigue loads is an essential aspect in this field of SHM, since it enables the optimization of turbine operation towards lower fatigue lifetime consumption and provides potential for the extension of service life. Fatigue loads can either be measured directly using strain gauges or indirectly reconstructed from the measurement of tower deformations in conjunction with a mechanical model, e. g., a finite element (FE) model. The indirect reconstruction can also be described by the notions of “virtual sensors” or “digital twin”. The current report presents how fatigue loads on relevant areas of offshore foundation structures, such as the tower-transition piece interface, can be reconstructed from acceleration and inclination measurements. The approach uses the structural responses recorded at the tower and an FE model to determine internal forces or moments in the structure. Using real examples from German offshore wind farms, the effect of the available measurement information and considered load assumptions on the estimation accuracy is shown. The effects of uncertainties from acquisition and model assumptions (e. g. calibration errors and soil stiffness) are also presented. © 2022, Ernst und Sohn. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Wind energy is one of the most versatile and promising sustainable energy solutions. Wind energy can be harvested in both onshore and offshore environments. Due to the environmental and societal impacts of onshore wind farms, the focus on developing offshore wind farms has been steadily increasing. For deep-water areas, floating wind turbine solutions have been developed in the past two decades. Each wind turbine is mounted on a floating structure and connected to a mooring system. While the floating wind turbine technology enables electricity generation in water depths where fixed-foundation turbines are not feasible, operation and maintenance (O&M) have become serious issues. This paper investigates the challenges and potential enabling technologies for the development of autonomous floating offshore wind farms. In particular, the paper explores the potential utilization of information and communication technology (ICT) and robotics toward fully autonomous floating offshore wind farm O&M, aiming for cost reduction and improved operational safety. The presented solutions cover fundamental aspects in floating platform design, remote operation in the form of digital twins, autonomous underwater robots and surface vehicles, and eco-friendly energy storage. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Currently, dry-type transformers are commonly installed as wind turbine step-up (WTSU) transformers, especially in offshore wind farms. Due to their low flammability and resistance to moisture, their performance is optimal in offshore platforms. Nonetheless, their thermal-electrical degradation must be carefully considered given the special wind and weather conditions in marine environments. The present paper studies the thermal aging of dry-type WTSU transformers in offshore wind farms considering the most thermally stressed location i.e. the winding hot-spot. The estimation of the transformer lifetime consumption introduced in this work can be applied in the framework of digital twins for diagnostic and prognostic monitoring purposes The thermal degradation study is based on a typical offshore load profile and includes the analysis of the impact of several transformer characteristics and operating conditions. As a result of the analysis, it can be concluded that lower temperature insulations, forced air cooling systems, a lower mean winding temperature rise and cool ambient temperatures lead to decreased loss of life values. Also, the present work suggests the suitability of considering thermal degradation studies as an optimal sizing factor for offshore WTSU given the low ambient temperatures in marine environment and the low capacity factors. © 2020, International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.},

	abstract = {The number of installed floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) has doubled since 2017, quadrupling the total installed capacity, and is expected to increase significantly over the next decade. Consequently, there is a growing consideration towards the main challenges for FOWT projects: monitoring the system’s integrity, extending the lifespan of the components, and maintaining FOWTs safely at scale. Effectively and efficiently addressing these challenges would unlock the wide-scale deployment of FOWTs. In this work, we focus on one of the most critical components of the FOWTs, the Mooring Lines (MoLs), which are responsible for fixing the structure to the seabed. The primary mechanical failure mechanisms in MoLs are extreme load and fatigue, both of which are functions of the axial tension. An effective solution to detect long-term drifts in the mechanical response of the MoLs is to develop a Digital Twin (DT) able to accurately predict the behaviour of the healthy system to compare with the actual one. Moreover, we will develop another DT able to accurately predict the near future axial tension as an effective tool to improve the lifespan of the MoLs and the safety of FOWT maintenance operations. In fact, by changing the FOWT operational settings, according to the DT prediction, operators can increase the lifespan of the MoLs by reducing the stress and, additionally, in the case where FOWT operational maintenance is in progress, the prediction from the DT can serve as early safety warning to operators. Authors will leverage operational data collected from the world’s first commercial floating-wind farm [the Hywind Pilot Park (https://www.equinor.com/en/what-we-do/floating-wind/hywind-scotland.html.)] in 2018, to investigate the effectiveness of DTs for the prediction of the MoL axial tension for the two scenarios depicted above. The DTs will be developed using state-of-the-art data-driven methods, and results based on real operational data will support our proposal. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Offshore wind turbines are exposed to fluctuating environmental loads and have to deal with aero-hydro-servo-elastic coupled dynamics. Such complex engineering systems need thorough design processes, as well as sophisticated monitoring and maintenance approaches. The current development trend towards floating support structures for offshore wind turbines makes maintenance and repair work more difficult. This is, on the one hand, as access to, transfer of personnel to, and work of technicians on floating systems are complicated and entail additional hazards. On the other hand, floating wind turbines can be located further from the shore, which significantly reduces the allowable weather windows for offshore work. Thus, researchers and industry must not only focus on efficient maintenance strategies but also put more emphasis on the design process of such offshore structures, focusing on reliable systems ab initio. For reliability assessments of highly complex engineering systems, the combination of different techniques-building on approaches for creating approximate system representations and subsequent reliability analysis and calculation methods-is most promising1 . The development and assessment of floating wind turbine systems, however, also requires numerical modeling to correctly represent and simulate the fully coupled dynamics. The Modelica® library for Wind Turbines MoWiT (www.mowit.info), developed at Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy Systems IWES, allows for component-based modeling and can be coupled to a framework, programmed in Python, for automated simulation and optimization2 . To incorporate the computationally intensive reliability assessment within the highly iterative optimization process, a methodology is developed, by which means approximate models in form of response surfaces for a few potential system geometries out of the entire optimization design space are created ahead of the optimization, corresponding response surfaces for any other system designs are derived based on an interpolation approach, and, finally, the reliability is determined time-efficiently within the optimization procedure, using Monte-Carlo simulation3 . This methodology is applied to a floating wind turbine to obtain a reliability-based optimized support structure, accounting for uncertainties in environmental conditions directly within the design development and ensuring that the structure, including the mooring lines, fulfills certain reliability constraints3 . Furthermore, the numerical framework allows developing digital twins by optimizing the numerical model based on measurements. Such digital twins are highly suitable to assess the system condition and estimate, e.g., the damage or remaining lifetime. © ESREL 2021. Published by Research Publishing, Singapore.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, renewable energy has attracted attention as a viable energy supply. Among renewable energy sources, offshore wind energy has been considerably growing since longer and larger wind turbine composite blades were deployed. The manufacture of the longer and larger composite blades leads to more wind energy production. However, the wind turbine composite blades are susceptible to damage and defects due to multiple structural loads and harsh operating environments in service. Hence, condition monitoring and maintenance of wind turbine composite blades require in-depth investigation to prevent structural damage and defects and to improve remaining lifetime of the composite structure. The types of damage and defects in wind turbine composite blades are typically delamination, debonding, and cracks, which are influenced by the intrinsic structural nonlinearities, manufacturing process stage, and harsh environmental impacts in service. For these reasons, the regular condition monitoring of the composite blades is required to assess degradation in performance and structural condition to minimise levelised energy costs for maintenance. To improve reliability and sustainability, data-driven inspection with digital twin technology is reviewed as a trend of condition monitoring frameworks. Advanced functional materials to potentially assist current non-destructive testing (NDT) methods or to be utilised as self-sensing performance are reviewed. From manufacturing to the system level, a comprehensive review on progress and trends of monitoring of wind turbine composite blades is carried out including physics-based NDT methods, data fusion in sensor networks, automated system, mechanics, and digital twin technology with the environmental coupling. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {This paper presents a digital twin (DT) condition monitoring approach for drivetrains on floating offshore wind turbines. Digital twin in this context consists of torsional dynamic model, online measurements and fatigue damage estimation which is used for remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. At first, methods for system parameter estimation are presented. The digital twin model provides sufficient inputs for the load observers designed in specific points of the drivetrain to estimate the online load and subsequently stress in the different components. The estimated real-time stress values feed the degradation model of the components. The stochastic degradation model proposed for estimation of real-time fatigue damage in the components is based on a proven model-based approach which is tested under different drivetrain operations, namely normal, faulty and overload conditions. The uncertainties in model, measurements and material properties are addressed, and confidence interval for the estimations is provided by a detailed analysis on the signal behavior and using Monte Carlo simulations. A test case, using 10 MW drivetrain, has been demonstrated. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The Digital Twin (DT) paradigm offers an extension of simulation model utility into the operational phase of an engineering asset. The goal is a simulation “twinned” with observed data that reflects the actual performance of the asset. However, exploring sources of uncertainty for both the physical asset and the simulation model are a challenge. For example, random metocean conditions, and uncertainty on model parameters and response behaviour of offshore wind turbine (OWT) structures, contribute to uncertainty for predicted life under fatigue. In-service assessment of OWT structures will benefit from twinning simulations and observed data, where a framework to treat this uncertainty is defined. The DT needs to capture state, condition, and behaviour to a level that allows quantification and propagation of uncertainty for reliability analysis. Using a DT, built for fatigue assessment of bolted ring-flanges on OWT support structures, this paper explores the challenges and opportunities in defining uncertainties of interest. We propagate these uncertainties through the DT in a coherent manner using a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate modelling approach, efficiently emulating a computationally expensive numerical simulator. The GP is an attractive surrogate model method given this computational efficiency, in addition to providing an estimate of prediction uncertainty at unobserved points in the output space. The use of the GP surrogate model is included within a definition of the Surrogate DT, a framework including “fast” and “slow” twinning processes. We define six requirements to apply DTs to OWT structures which provide practical guidelines for modelling this complex asset under uncertainty. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {While Floating Offshore Wind (FOW) represents a significant opportunity to foster wind energy development and to contribute to remarkable CO2 emissions reductions, its associated operational costs are still substantially above grid parity, and significant innovation is needed. MooringSense is a research and innovation project which explores digitisation technologies to enable the implementation of risk-based integrity management strategies for mooring systems in the FOW sector with the aim to optimise Operations and Maintenance (O&M) activities, reduce costs, and increase energy production. As part of this project, a risk-based assessment methodology specific for the mooring system of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWT) has been developed; this allows the development of a risk-based Mooring Integrity Management Strategy that can result in more cost-effective inspection planning. The methodology shall utilise the information made available by numerical tools, sensors, and algorithms developed in the project to update the risk level of the mooring system and set the required plan to mitigate the risk. Leveraging the additional information from monitoring technologies and predictive capabilities to determine the mooring system condition and remaining lifetime, the strategy provides the criteria for optimal decision making with regards to selection of O&M activities. The risk-based strategy developed allows for optimal planning of inspection and maintenance activities based on dynamic risk level that is periodically updated through the interface with the Digital Twin (DT). The validation of the strategy will demonstrate potential cost saving and economic advantages, however, it is expected that the overall MooringSense approach can reduce FOW farm operational costs by 10-15% and increase operational efficiency by means of an Annual Energy Production increase by 2-3%. The MooringSense project comprises of the development and validation of innovative solutions coming from multiple disciplines such as numerical modelling, simulation, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), and control systems which will provide valuable input to the risk-based mooring integrity management strategy. © Copyright 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers},

	abstract = {The computational cost of the design optimisation of wind turbines, as well as the optimisation of the operation and maintenance of offshore wind farms represents a limitation to the application of conventional simulation methods. New techniques such as reduced order modelling (ROM) and technologies such as hybrid-analysis methods and digital twins have increased in popularity due to their ability to deliver numerical results at a significant speedup with reasonable accuracy. This work presents a hybrid projection-based proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) strategy applied to transient turbulent flow problems. Key feature of this work is the applicability of the methodology to high Reynolds number cases and the stabilisation of pressure in the online phase via the assembly of the so-called pressure Poisson equation. Another significant part of this work is the implementation of an interpolation scheme for the eddy viscosity field in the classical POD-Galerkin strategy. The sampling procedure and the calculation of the reduced operators in the offline phase is carried out using the finite volume method (FVM), OpenFOAM's libraries specifically, while the construction of the reduced basis and the solution of the online phase is carried out in Python. The capability of the resulting ROM is tested using the two-dimensional flow around a NACA0015 airfoil at 17° angle of attack with Reynolds number of approximately 300 000. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The technology offers a possibility to increase the total energy production of floating wind farms by minimizing the wake effect. We assume each of the individual wind turbine is completed with a propulsion system and is allowed to reposition itself anywhere in the restricted domain. The simulations are performed in a digital twin platform based on Unity 3D, where wind speed and direction are used as inputs for the digital twin. Furthermore, Jensen's wake model is implemented to model the dynamic behaviour of the wind. To find an optimal position for all individual wind turbines, two methods are proposed. The first method is based on reactive control, while the second method is based on optimal control. The possible energy gains of dynamic repositioning with real-life scenarios are assessed to show the feasibility of the proposed method. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This paper presents a multi-degree of freedom torsional model of drivetrain system as the digital twin model for monitoring the remaining useful lifetime of the drivetrain components. An algorithm is proposed for the model identification, which receives the torsional response and estimated values of rotor and generator torques, and calculates the drivetrain dynamic properties, e.g. eigenvalues, and torsional model parameters. The applications of this model in prediction of gearbox remaining useful lifetime is discussed. The proposed method is computationally fast, and can be implemented by integrating with the current turbine control and monitoring system without a need for a new system and sensors installation.

	abstract = {Wind energy has gradually become one of the most efficient and reliable forms of sustainable energy, and it is being globally utilized to accelerate the expansion of green power production. However, recent projections of onshore & offshore wind energy systems indicate that further improvements are continuously required in terms of the deployments, capacity factors, costs, etc. to achieve an optimal wind power generation. According to these projections, the most critical current issue is the offshore systems' high levelized cost of energy, which demands the enhancements of the technologies to ensure the cost reduction in the future. Moreover, a number of reports are underscoring that offshore power systems can also leave a larger carbon footprints through their life-cycles compared to the onshore counterpart. On the other hand, the modelling methods of the power plants' life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) have nowadays become among the most compelling research problems in the field of wind power systems engineering. In addition to comparatively assessing the characteristics of onshore & offshore energy systems based on some reports & studies, this work is therefore aimed at rigorously exploring the existing study practices in modelling the wind power plants' LCIA. A number of these practices were based on the implementation of various conventional modelling methods that may not help to make accurate assessments of the wind power plants’ life-cycle impacts. Hence, one of the main contributions of this study is to summarize a novel LCIA modelling approach based on Internet of Things (IoT) and predictive digital twin technologies. Unlike the conventional methods, real-time data extraction from the power plants makes these technologies possible to conduct the most accurate assessments of the life-cycle impacts. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {The article presents a symbolic framework (also called computer algebra program) that is used to obtain, in symbolic mathematical form, the linear and nonlinear equations of motion of a mid-fidelity multibody system including rigid and flexible bodies. Our approach is based on Kane's method and a nonlinear shape function representation for flexible bodies. The shape function approach does not represent the state of the art for flexible multibody dynamics but is an effective trade-off to obtain mid-fidelity models with few degrees of freedom, taking advantage of the separation of space and time. The method yields compact symbolic equations of motion with implicit account of the constraints. The general and automatic framework facilitates the creation and manipulation of models with various levels of complexity by adding or removing degrees of freedom. The symbolic treatment allows for analytical gradients and linearized equations of motion. The linear and nonlinear equations can be exported to Python code or dedicated software. There are multiple applications, such as time domain simulation, stability analyses, frequency domain analyses, advanced controller design, state observers, and digital twins. In this article, we describe the method we used to systematically generate the equations of motion of multibody systems and present the implementation of the framework using the Python package SymPy. We apply the framework to generate illustrative land-based and offshore wind turbine models. We compare our results with OpenFAST simulations and discuss the advantages and limitations of the method. The Python implementation is provided as an open-source project.  © 2022 Earth System Science Data. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to develop a reliability assessment framework for the maintenance optimization of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) using an uncertainty-aware digital twin framework. OWTs are typically located far from the coastline to optimize wind utilization efficiency and minimize disruption of human activities. However, the greater distance between OWTs and the coast can increase maintenance costs due to accessibility and exposure to harsh weather conditions. Effective planning is crucial in managing these costs. Therefore, employing digital twin models for OWTs can provide potential benefits. A digital twin framework creates a virtual replica of the turbine and leverages multi-source data for real-time simulations, enabling assessment of the turbine's performance under various loading conditions, which can substantially enhance the maintenance decision-making process. The proposed framework has two main contributions: (1) uncertainty quantification in the long-term performance of OWTs at both the component and system levels, and (2) digital twin decision support leveraging OWT failure probabilities under various scenarios, which is used to provide maintenance recommendations aimed at optimizing system profitability and structural integrity. Additionally, the digital twin model provides clear and concise warnings regarding potential OWT failures. © 2023 by DEStech Publi cations, Inc. All rights reserved},

	abstract = {Predicting the output power of wind generators is essential to improve grid flexibility, which is vulnerable to power supply variability and uncertainty. Digital twins can help predict the output of a wind turbine using a variety of environmental data generated by real-world systems. This paper dealt with the development of a physics-based output prediction model (P-bOPM) for a 10 MW floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) for a digital twin. The wind power generator dealt with in this paper was modeled considering the NREL 5 MW standard wind turbine with a semi-submersible structure. A P-bOPM of a 10 MW FOWT for a digital twin was designed and simulated using ANSYS Twin Builder. By connecting the P-bOPM developed for the digital twin implementation with an external sensor through TCP/IP communication, it was possible to calculate the output of the wind turbine using real-time field data. As a result of evaluating the P-bOPM for various marine environments, it showed good accuracy. The digital twin equipped with the P-bOPM, which accurately reflects the variability of the offshore wind farm and can predict the output in real time, will be a great help in improving the flexibility of the power system in the future. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {It is currently a prevailing trend to adopt clean energies instead of traditional ones due to the global climate change caused by carbon emissions. Offshore wind farms, in particular, have emerged as a crucial source of renewable energy, owing to their benefits such as no land occupation and abundant resources. However, the design, installation, operation, and maintenance (O&M) of floating wind turbines (FWTs) involve multiple sources of heterogeneous data, which pose challenges to data integration and management, as well as to the simulation and analysis of FWTs. To address this issue, this study proposes a unified framework based on digital twin (DT) to acquire and integrate diverse types of information used throughout the entire life cycle of FWTs. A digital 3D model serves as a medium to enable real-time synchronization and inversion of sensor data, facilitating the simulation and analysis of the global state of FWTs. The proposed framework is evaluated through a case study of a twin-barge float-over project, which includes process simulation, mechanical analysis, and anomaly identification. The results demonstrate that DT can facilitate timely monitoring and analysis of FWTs, and enable visualization of construction plans, early warning of structural abnormalities, and accurate recognition of FWT posture and marine environment. The case study validates the efficacy of the proposed framework in ensuring personnel and equipment safety, optimizing project plans, and improving construction efficiency. © 2023 The Authors},

In this work, we focus on one of the most critical components of the FOWTs, the Mooring Lines (MoLs), which are responsible for fixing the structure to the seabed. The primary mechanical failure mechanisms in MoLs are extreme load and fatigue, both of which are functions of the axial tension. An effective solution to detect long term drifts in the mechanical response of the MoLs is to develop a Digital Twin (DT) able to accurately predict the behaviour of the healthy system to compare with the actual one. Authors will leverage operational data collected from the world's first commercial floating wind farm (Hywind Pilot Park1) in 2018, to investigate the effectiveness of the DT for the prediction of the MoL axial tension. The DT will be developed using state-of-the-art data-driven methods, and results based on real operational data will support our proposal.  © 2021 MTS.},

	abstract = {The assessment of anthropogenic impacts on the marine environment is challenged by the accessibility, accuracy and validity of biogeographical information. Offshore wind farm projects require large-scale ecological surveys before, during and after construction, in order to assess potential effects on the distribution and abundance of protected species. The robustness of site-specific population estimates depends largely on the extent and design of spatial coverage and the accuracy of the applied census technique. Standard environmental assessment studies in Germany have so far included aerial visual surveys to evaluate potential impacts of offshore wind farms on seabirds and marine mammals. However, low flight altitudes, necessary for the visual classification of species, disturb sensitive bird species and also hold significant safety risks for the observers. Thus, aerial surveys based on high-resolution digital imagery, which can be carried out at higher (safer) flight altitudes (beyond the rotor-swept zone of the wind turbines) have become a mandatory requirement, technically solving the problem of distant-related observation bias. A purpose-assembled imagery system including medium-format cameras in conjunction with a dedicated geo-positioning platform delivers series of orthogonal digital images that meet the current technical requirements of authorities for surveying marine wildlife at a comparatively low cost. At a flight altitude of 425 m, a focal length of 110 mm, implemented forward motion compensation (FMC) and exposure times ranging between 1/1600 and 1/1000 s, the twin-camera system generates high quality 16 bit RGB images with a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 2 cm and an image footprint of 155 × 410 m. The image files are readily transferrable to a GIS environment for further editing, taking overlapping image areas and areas affected by glare into account. The imagery can be routinely screened by the human eye guided by purpose-programmed software to distinguish biological from non-biological signals. Each detected seabird or marine mammal signal is identified to species level or assigned to a species group and automatically saved into a geo-database for subsequent quality assurance, geo-statistical analyses and data export to third-party users. The relative size of a detected object can be accurately measured which provides key information for species-identification. During the development and testing of this system until 2015, more than 40 surveys have produced around 500.000 digital aerial images, of which some were taken in specially protected areas (SPA) of the Baltic Sea and thus include a wide range of relevant species. Here, we present the technical principles of this comparatively new survey approach and discuss the key methodological challenges related to optimizing survey design and workflow in view of the pending regulatory requirements for effective environmental impact assessments.},

	abstract = {In this paper a novel Data-Driven Design and Operation approach is introduced for an offshore wind energy application to account for site-specific conditions. Data from operational state of a turbine, e.g. accelerations, strain gauges, and SCADA, are intended to be used in the True Digital Twin concept to improve initial design assumptions. A calibrated numerical model combined with measured loading and response models allows to update the structural reliability and thus quantify the potential inherent conservatism. Given this additional knowledge the lifetime extension of existing structures can be assessed while for future structures their design procedures can be optimized according to a chosen cost function. The conceptual framework for including new information from measurements based on the Bayesian updating is presented in the paper. It is demonstrated how the initially assumed generic uncertainties regarding numerical models and environmental conditions can be consistently updated based on the site-specific data and hence lead to a more reliable design and operation of a structure. New information derived from data is accounted for based on the pre-posterior decision procedures supplemented with robust decision rules. © 2019 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).},
