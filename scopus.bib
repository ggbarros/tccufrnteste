	abstract = {Bridges are valuable infrastructure assets that are challenging and expensive to maintain. State-of-the-art data-based bridge SHM solutions look to use bridge response data for condition assessment and damage detection. Data-based SHM methods can be limited in their application as they require large datasets to train models effectively, and most bridges lack the available data for the approaches to work. Further, it would be expensive and unrealistic to collect the required datasets to employ data-based methods to entire bridge networks. Recently, a population-based structural health monitoring (PBSHM) approach was proposed that seeks to leverage the data available for SHM problems by pooling together similar structures with their datasets. The PBSHM approach could be valuable in bridge SHM, enhancing the datasets available for ‘populations of bridges. The PBSHM approach for assessing the similarity of bridges has been considered before and was shown to be useful for identifying similar and different bridge types. However, no data were considered in the previous work, and similarity metrics were only qualified using engineering judgement. For the PBSHM approach to be useful in bridge SHM, there is still a need to check that ‘similar’ bridges have similar responses for transfer learning to be feasible. This paper expands upon previous work and provides originality by investigating if bridges identified as similar also exhibit similar responses. The PBSHM derived similarity metrics convey the topological similarity between structures, and mode shapes are identified as being a topologically sensitive bridge response. Therefore, a modal test campaign is carried out for a set of six real bridges, and Operational Modal Analysis is used to identify modal responses from each of the bridge decks. The Modal Assurance Criterion is used to evaluate the similarity between the mode shapes from pairs of bridges and is subsequently compared to the similarity metrics evaluated between those bridges. The similarity metrics were found to be reflective of the similarities identified between the respective bridges’ mode shapes for bridges of the same and different types. The significance of this finding is that it is an important step towards validating the PBSHM comparison approach for identify similar structures where transfer learning might be attempted. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {In industrial scenarios, mechanical faults are episodic and uncertain. Thus, the monitoring data collected is usually extremely imbalanced, resulting in intelligent diagnostic models that suffer from majority-class dominance, minority-class overfitting, and poor generalization performance. Therefore, a knowledge distillation-guided cost-sensitive ensemble learning framework is proposed. It effectively combines ensemble learning and cost-sensitive learning to fully extract the multiscale features, effectively leverage the critical multidepth features, and emphasize classifying the most confusing classes. Specifically, multiple-scale feature extraction and multiorder fusion are first employed to fully utilize the fault information. Afterward, the complementary diagnostic knowledge at different depths of the network is embedded into a novel ensemble learning process for better integration decisions. Then an improved knowledge distillation method achieves the mutual transfer and sublimation of excellent diagnostic knowledge while focusing on the most confusing fault classes to achieve the effective representation of various types of faults. Finally, a cost-sensitive strategy is applied to further increase attention to minority classes. The experimental results for various complex data imbalance scenarios, including extreme imbalance, step imbalance, continuous imbalance, interclass imbalance, and intraclass imbalance, all indicate that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance and provide a promising solution for the practical industrial application of intelligent diagnostic methods. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The collisions between bridges and ships might cause severe damage to both of them, which is impossible to avoid completely, although several specifications or requirements need to be followed in the design of bridges and during the navigation of ships passing bridge. Many researches on protective technology had been conducted to reduce the potentially disastrous consequences. These technologies can be broadly categorized into two main types: the technologies of collision avoidance, which try to reduce the collision possibility by warning the passing ship that might impact the bridge; and passive collision protections, which use protective structures to minimize the damage of bridge and ship due to impact. The purpose of the present paper is to systematically summarize both classifications and then provide insights into their characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, and suitable conditions for application. Additionally, the related approaches originally designed for other applications but with potential relevance are also discussed, such as ship-ship collision avoidance.

	abstract = {The global installed capacity of floating offshore wind turbines is projected to increase by at least 100 times over the next decades. Station-keeping of floating offshore renewable energy devices is achieved through the use of mooring systems. Mooring systems are exposed to a variety of environmental and operational conditions that cause corrosion, abrasion, and fatigue. Regular physical in-service inspections of mooring systems are the golden standard for monitoring their health status. This approach is often expensive, inefficient, and unsafe, and for this reason, researchers are focusing on developing tools for digital solutions for real-time monitoring. Floating offshore renewable energy devices are usually equipped with a wide range of sensors, some low-cost, low/zero maintenance, and easily deployable (e.g., accelerometers on the tower), contrary to others (e.g., direct tension mooring line measurements), producing real-time data streams. In this paper, we propose exploiting the data coming from the first type of sensors for mooring systems health status nowcasting. In particular, we will first rely on state-of-the-art supervised shallow and deep learning models for predicting the health status of the different sections of the mooring lines. Then, since these supervised models require types and amount of data that are seldom available, we will propose new shallow and deep weekly supervised models that require a very small amount of data regarding worn mooring lines. Results will show that these last models can potentially have practical applicability and impact for real-time monitoring of mooring systems in the near future. In order to support our statements, we will make use of data generated with a state-of-the-art digital twin of the mooring system, OrcaFlex, for a floating offshore wind turbine reproducing the physical mechanism of the mooring degradation under different loads and environmental conditions. Results will show errors around 1% in the simplest scenario and errors around 4% in the most challenging one, confirming the potentiality of the proposed approaches. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {The data-driven fault diagnostic methods have made significant advances and breakthroughs in the past decades. However, due to the huge time and labor costs, single user is hard to collect sufficient monitoring data for model training and multiple users are preferred for collaborative modeling with distributed data. Considering the concerns of data privacy or conflicts of interest, the local data of different users cannot be directly shared with others for centralized training. Moreover, they are usually sampled from different working environments, leading to data island and distribution shift issues. To solve the two issues, this paper proposes a novel cloud-edge collaborative transfer fault diagnosis approach for rotating machinery. The federated learning scheme is introduced for collaborative modeling of multiple users while ensuring the data privacy of participants. To bridge the distribution gap across clients, the source training module is constructed to conduct local model training on insufficient labeled data from different users, and a federated fine-tuning module is then developed to remove distribution discrepancies between different source users, thus building accurate source models. Finally, a target self-adaptation module is designed to reduce prediction differences of source client models on target samples and achieve effective adaptation of the target client to source clients. Comprehensive comparative analysis shows that the proposed approach achieves a performance gain of 0.45% to the traditional centralized transfer learning method, demonstrating its potential in addressing the data island and distribution shift issues in practical applications. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The growing demand for renewable energy has made wind turbines increasingly large and complex. Demand for efficient main bearings optimized to endure dynamic and unpredictable stresses while allowing turbine motion rises even more. Over the years, rolling element bearings have advanced to meet this demand, driven by innovations from industry and academia. This study examined industry-related and academic contributions to the advancement of wind turbine main bearings. Spherical and tapered roller bearings are identified as the basic wind turbine rotor bearings. From the works reviewed, it was found that industry-related contributions on these bearings center on bearing configuration improvements, cage improvements, the development of improved coats, and the design of novel evolutionary variants of the bearings. The SKF was identified as having contributed more to the development of wind turbine rotor bearings with the patenting of two novel bearings: the CARB toroidal bearing and the Nautilus. Scholarly contributions have majored in bearing geometry and profile optimization. Tapered roller bearings were found to have received more research attention than spherical roller bearings. Also, few innovative studies on CARB toroidal bearing, asymmetrical spherical roller bearing, and the Nautilus have been reported. Exclusively theoretical analyses have been mostly used in performance optimizations of the bearings. Only in a few studies did experimental investigations validate theoretical findings, creating potential avenues for experimental studies. Insights from the review indicate that tapered roller bearings or plain bearings could be viable substitute for spherical main shaft bearings, considering their persistent reliability challenges. The authors recommend more exploration of evolutionary bearing optimization techniques, more investigations on bearing lubricants, housing material, cage material, and coating material designs, and increased industry-academic engagement to pave the way for more main bearing innovation. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {While most industrial maintenance strategies are centered on optimizing machine runtime and cost reduction, the condition-based maintenance (CBM) strategy distinguishes itself from others in its use of real-time operational data from machines to help engineers make informed decisions. The introduction of machine learning (ML) into a CBM strategy can increase its effectiveness, enabling more accurate predictions and making the decision-making process more efficient. In this review paper, we seek to provide a comprehensive overview of the role ML plays in modern CBM systems, beginning by outlining the core concepts and historical development of CBM and briefly introducing various ML techniques being employed in industry today. We then review numerous real-world cases where ML-based CBM systems have been implemented and discuss some of the technological, human, and ethical challenges faced by organizations seeking to integrate sophisticated ML models into existing CBM systems. We end by highlighting some of the current limitations of ML-based CBM systems, paving the way for a discussion on emerging trends and future research directions in this area. © 2024, Prognostics and Health Management Society.

	abstract = {A machine's remaining useful life (RUL) is a challenging issue that indicates how much useful life is left. In the past, models based on statistical characteristics taken from signals collected by attaching sensors to a machine have been created to estimate how much longer a machine will be functional. This works fine when the machine is subjected to the same operating conditions. However, in the real-time scenario, the machine is operated under different conditions. As a result, the model developed under one condition does not work satisfactorily for another condition. In this work, we have explored various features for the prognosis and estimation of the RUL of the rolling element bearing. A health indicator has been developed by applying Isometric Mapping (ISOMAP) to the tangent entropy features extracted from the vibration data's 16-bandpass filtered frequency domain signal. The pro-offered health indicator exhibits the monotonic degradation trend and can be utilized to develop the data-driven model for determining the RUL of the bearing. For the effective working of the model under different operating conditions, feature-based and instant-based domain adaptation is applied so that the model can be reliably used under cross-domain operating conditions. After applying domain adaptation, it has been found that the model can give the same level of performance as it gives when whole data of different conditions are used for developing the model. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Offshore wind energy has become a key strategy in the global transition to sustainable and renewable energy. This emphasis has significantly propelled the advancement of offshore wind turbine technology. However, fatigue of offshore wind turbine support structures remains a significant challenge due to long-term exposure to harsh environmental conditions. In this study, an intelligent optimization-inspired Support Vector Regression (SVR) modeling strategy is proposed to construct a high-precision approximation model. Compared with original SVR modeling method, the modeling strategy proposed in this study has higher accuracy in building models of complex engineering structures. Additionally, a fatigue reliability evaluation framework considering hybrid uncertainty is presented. The new reliability evaluation framework can be combined with a variety of heuristic algorithms to unleash the potential of heuristic algorithms. Finally, this study applies the proposed framework to an example of fatigue reliability evaluation of offshore wind turbine support structures considering the effects of multiple uncertainties. The performance of different heuristic algorithms under the proposed framework is compared in this study. Furthermore, this study mainly finds that the MAE index of the established SVR model using the intelligent optimization algorithm is 31.2% higher than that of the SVR model that does not use the intelligent optimization algorithm. Compared with the fatigue reliability evaluation that only considers random uncertainty, the failure probability of the fatigue reliability evaluation using hybrid uncertainty is 0.64% higher. The fatigue reliability evaluation framework considering hybrid uncertainties proposed in this study is more accurate and conservative. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Floating nuclear power plants (FNPPs) have the potential to supply abundant electricity, hot water, and freshwater resources for offshore islands and offshore oil and gas extraction platforms. However, the consequences of a nuclear reactor accident can be extremely serious. In addition, there may be many uncertain factors in the actual operation of FNPPs. These factors lead to higher structural safety requirements. So， developing more scientific structural monitoring methods is an effective way to enhance the structural safety of FNPP. Traditional hull monitoring schemes can only track bending and torsional forces on specific cross-sections, failing to identify the overall stress field of the entire vessel structure. The paper proposes a reconstruction method for the stress field, bending moment distribution, and wave parameters of FNPP using regular wave identification. Initially, irregular waves are decomposed into a linear combination of multiple regular waves with different amplitudes and frequencies. Subsequently, the strains induced by these regular waves on the FNPP are utilized as basic functions to establish a mathematical model for reconstructing the stress field. The stress field, bending moment distribution, and wave parameters of the FNPP can be reconstructed by identifying the combination coefficients of the regular wave loads. The ill-posedness of the mathematical model for stress field reconstruction has the potential to significantly impact the accuracy of the stress field reconstruction, which was addressed by optimizing the sensor installation position in this study. Meanwhile, the optimization of the sensor installation position greatly reduces the dimensionality of mathematical models. Finally, a numerical study, i.e. FNPP being designed by China, was used to validate the accuracy of the proposed stress field reconstruction algorithm. The reconstructed stress field of the FNPP closely matched the original stress distribution under various irregular wave conditions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Gearbox fault diagnosis is a critical aspect of machinery maintenance and reliability, as it ensures the safe and efficient operation of various industrial systems. The cross-domain fault diagnosis method based on transfer learning has been extensively researched to enhance the engineering applications of data-driven methods. Currently, the state-of-the-art gearbox cross-domain fault diagnosis primarily relies on single-modal data, which may not capture the full information needed for robust fault diagnosis under varying conditions. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-modal data cross-domain fusion network that utilizes vibration signals and thermal images to capture comprehensive information about the gearbox's health conditions. First, one-dimensional and two-dimensional convolutional neural networks are constructed for feature extraction and fusion of multi-modal data. Then, the Maximum Mean Discrepancy loss is introduced to achieve cross-domain feature alignments within the modal. Finally, the cross-modal consistency learning strategy is constructed to enhance the cross-domain diagnosis performance of the model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on a real-world gearbox test rig. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to single-modal methods and existing fusion methods in terms of diagnosis performance, proving that the proposed method offers a promising solution for gearbox fault diagnosis in industrial settings. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a novel deep learning model that integrates a variational autoencoder (VAE) and a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) for detecting abnormalities in wind turbine blades. The deep learning model is trained using dynamic response data from normally operating blades. Abnormalities are identified when the predicted dynamic responses deviate from the measured ones. Unlike commonly used models like LSTM and GRU that predict time series in the original data space, the proposed model conducts time series prediction in a compressed latent space. The fusion of the VAE and the neural ODE delivers two distinct advantages: (1) the VAE filters out noise and accentuates the underlying structure of data, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy; (2) the time series prediction executed by the neural ODE transpires within the compressed latent space, enabling predictions of extended time series without the need to predict each individual time point directly. The effectiveness of the proposed anomaly detection method is evaluated using both numerical and experimental wind turbine blades. The results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning model outperforms LSTM, GRU, and neural ODE in terms of time series prediction capabilities. Furthermore, the proposed method proves effective in identifying progressive degradation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Operational modal analysis is used to identify modal parameters of a rotating machine, more specifically an axial compressor. The application of operational modal analysis to rotating machines is considered a challenge, since the rotation disturbs the output measured and can be falsely identified as structural characteristics. Thus, an effective approach to handle the rotor speed harmonics consisting of a modified technique for harmonic removal and a criterion for the identification of harmonics is presented. Additionally, the axial compressor investigated in this work is characterized by numerous joints introducing friction. Thus, localized nonlinear structural behavior needs to be taken into account, when determining the sought-after modal parameters. In order to deal with the friction influence leading to varying eigenfrequencies and damping ratios with increasing response amplitudes, an operating point dependent modal parameter identification process is proposed. The damping values, which are identified in operation, decrease by up to one order of magnitude from the modal damping in standstill condition.

	abstract = {In geotechnical engineering, geological uncertainty and the inherent spatial variability of soil properties are two primary sources of uncertainty, significantly impacting embedded geo-structures. While the influence of the soil spatial variability and geological uncertainty has been separately investigated, the coupling effect of these two types of uncertainties on tunnel is still limited. Meanwhile, little effort has been devoted to quantifying the degree of importance of these two types of uncertainties. This study quantitatively evaluates the effects of geological uncertainty and soil spatial variability on tunnels, and first assess the importance of these two uncertainties based on a novel approach. Improved coupled Markov chain model was utilized to simulate the geological uncertainty based on sparse and limited boreholes. The coefficient of variation (COV) was adopted to characterize the different levels of soil spatial variability in this study. The results illuminated the role of geological uncertainty and spatial variability in tunnel probabilistic analysis by comparing different boreholes schemes and COV. In addition, the geological uncertainty index (GUI) was presented to quantitatively estimate the degree of uncertainty in the simulated strata. A novel approach for evaluating the significance of geological uncertainty and soil spatial variability on tunnel was proposed. Based on the Kendall correlation coefficient, the classification was also given, divided into high, strong, moderate, weak and no correlation. The geological uncertainty should be considered in high and strong correlation groups. Both two types of uncertainties should be simultaneously taken into account in moderate and weak correlation divisions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

This marks the first time that multi-head graph attention networks are introduced into the AE source zone localization task. This method introduces two key innovations: (1) Damage zone localization for wind turbine blades using only a single sensor. (2) Exceptional localization performance in the presence of noisy AE signals. First, the original AE signals are processed using exponential smoothing to effectively smooth them out and eliminate noise. Next, the smoothed AE signals undergo decomposition through continuous wavelet transform (CWT), and the resulting wavelet coefficients are utilized as node features. Euclidean distances between node features are calculated to assess the connectivity within graphs. Additionally, a new aggregation method is introduced for multi-head graph attention networks to enhance the robustness of the proposed method under noisy conditions. Finally, the effectiveness of the ESMGAT method is validated using the dataset from pencil lead break (PLB) tests conducted on a segment of a wind turbine blade. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

This study introduces a novel federated learning (FL) framework based on XGBoost models, enabling safe collaborative modeling with accessible yet concealed data from multiple parties. Hyperparameter tuning of the models is achieved through Bayesian Optimization. To ascertain the merits of the proposed FL-XGBoost method, a comparative analysis is conducted between separate and centralized models to address a classical binary classification problem in the geoenergy sector. The results reveal that the proposed FL framework strikes an optimal balance between privacy and accuracy. FL models demonstrate superior accuracy and generalization capabilities compared to separate models, particularly for participants with limited data or low correlation features, and offer significant privacy benefits compared to centralized models. The aggregated optimization approach within the FL agreement proves effective in tuning hyperparameters.

	abstract = {All diesel-only trains in the UK will be phased out by 2040. Hydrogen and ammonia emerge as alternative zero-carbon fuel for greener railway. Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) provide an alternative prime mover option, which efficiently convert zero-carbon fuels into electricity without emitting nitrogen oxides (NOx), unlike traditional engines. Superior to Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) in efficiency, SOFCs fulfil MW-scale power needs and can use ammonia directly. This study investigates innovative strategies for integrating SOFCs into hybrid rail powertrains using hydrogen or ammonia. Utilizing an optimization framework incorporating Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), the study aims to minimize operational costs while considering capital and replacement expenditures, powertrain performance, and component sizing. The findings suggest that hybrid powertrains based on ammonia-fueled SOFCs may potentially reduce costs by 30% compared to their hydrogen counterparts, albeit requiring additional space for engine compartments. Ammonia-fueled SOFCs trains also exhibit a 5% higher efficiency at End-of-Life (EoL), showing less performance degradation than those powered by hydrogen. The State of Charge (SoC) of the batteries in range of 30–70% for both cases is identified as most cost-effective. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) predominantly emphasize spatial features of signals and often fall short in prioritizing sequential features. As the number of layers increases, they are prone to issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients, leading to training instability and subsequent erratic fluctuations in loss values and recognition rates. To address this issue, a novel hybrid model, termed one-dimensional (1D) residual network with attention mechanism and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU) is developed for rotating machinery fault classification. First, a novel 1D residual network with optimized structure is constructed to obtain spatial features and mitigate the gradient vanishing or exploding. Second, the attention mechanism (AM) is designed to catch important impact characteristics for fault samples. Next, temporal features are mined through the BGRU. Finally, feature information is summarized through global average pooling, and the fully connected layer is utilized to output the final classification result for rotating machinery fault diagnosis. The developed technique which is tested on one set of planetary gear data and three different sets of bearing data, has achieved classification accuracy of 98.5%, 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. Compared with other methods, including CNN, CNN-BGRU, CNN-AM, and CNN with an AM-BGRU, the proposed technique has the highest recognition rate and stable diagnostic performance. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Critical problems such as data variability, system inefficiencies, and predictive maintenance are addressed by the integration of ML in renewable energy systems. Machine learning improves solar irradiance prediction accuracy and maximizes photovoltaic system performance in the solar energy sector. ML algorithms help to generate electricity more reliably by enhancing wind speed forecasts and wind turbine efficiency. ML improves the efficiency of biofuel production by optimizing feedstock selection, process parameters, and yield forecasts. Similarly, ML models in biomass energy provide effective thermal conversion procedures and real-time process management, guaranteeing increased energy production and operational stability. Even with the enormous advantages, problems such as data quality, interpretability of the models, computing requirements, and integration with current systems still remain. Resolving these issues calls for interdisciplinary cooperation, developments in computer technology, and encouraging legislative frameworks.

	abstract = {Currently, large-diameter monopile-supported offshore wind turbines (OWTs) are widely used in offshore areas of China. However, considerable numbers of wind farms are located in seismically active areas with liquefiable soil layers. Therefore, shaking table tests and numerical simulation based on a scaled model of Siemens SWT-4.0-130 OWTs were carried out to investigate the failure mechanism of the OWT system in liquefiable sand under combined wind, wave and seismic loads. The scaling law focusing on the governing physical mechanism of the OWT system considering multi-field coupling are presented and verified. The dynamic responses of the OWT and the excess pore pressure fluctuation around the soil-monopile domain in different operating states are discussed and compared. The results show that the proposed scaling laws can well restore the dynamic characteristics of the prototype. The seismic excitation is the dominant load for inducing the structural response under combined wind, wave and seismic loads. Due to the coupling effect, the dynamic responses under combined wind and wave loads were slightly less than the superposition of structural responses under separated wind or wave loads. Liquefaction of the shallow soil layer within the range of four times the pile diameter was detected when the PGA reached 0.4 g (three-dimensional input) or 0.64 g (one-dimensional input), which induced obvious tilt and settlement of the OWT model after the test. The sudden increase in the pore pressure resulted in the liquefaction of soil, which further led to a significant decrease in the natural frequencies and decay of the acceleration responses at the tower top. The above findings are expected to provide valuable experience for the 1 g underwater shaking table tests on OWT systems and insights for the practical design of OWTs in seismically active areas. © 2024},

However, the waveform is difficult to analyze due to damping and interference. Data-driven methods can help concatenate multidimensional signals and complex rail-surface irregularities but are impressionably uncertain. This study proposes a method in which a deep learning framework is coupled with heterogeneous factors at every link in its ensemble strategy. The instantiation, module foundation, and scenario description establish a concrete system for dealing with the dilemma that an insufficient database hinders feature extraction, causing unproductive capacity. The performance is quantitatively discussed by combining different levels of on-site rail-surface conditions, reaching prediction errors of 4.7% and 6.5% and classifier accuracies of 98.4% and 93.7% for irregularities and defect severities, respectively.

	abstract = {Background: Traditional fatigue testing methods can be expensive due to the need of specialised equipment for engineering materials and structures. Thus, a new fatigue testing approach utilising machining cutting forces to induce cyclic stresses, enabling fatigue life assessment of engineering materials and structures, has been developed. Objective: This research aims to develop and verify a new testing approach using machining processes to enable the fatigue life assessment of engineering materials and structures. This is achieved by the utilisation of machining-induced cutting forces to generate cyclic stresses into welded samples used in applications of wind turbine monopile structures. Methods: The methodology employes the development of a fixture encompassed with strain gauges and purposefully designed machining operations to mimic the cyclic stresses experienced in real applications. The machining-based fatigue testing approach was demonstrated on welded samples by replicating cyclic stresses of offshore wind turbine monopiles subject to in-service loads. Results: The results show that rapid fatigue testing of engineering materials and structures is possible by utilising existing machine tools and centres, which are widely accessible to industry. Cyclic stresses were induced in welded structural steel samples proving the concept of this method. Conclusion: This novel fatigue testing method showed that cyclic stresses can be induced by machining cutting forces to address real application needs. The key advantages are that this method can be quickly set up in industry, enabling fast fatigue testing that can lead to reduction of lead times for product and process development of industrial components. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {District heating is one of the main strategies for providing heat supply for buildings in cold climate countries. However, large parts of the current prefabricated pipes of these networks are reaching the end of their technical service life. Replacing these pipes is a time-consuming procedure and requires huge investments. Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is a promising strategy to deal with these situations and to optimize and prioritize maintenance activities. This paper surveys different PdM approaches considering difficulties in implementing PdMs in district heating networks (DHNs) compared with other energy sectors. It demonstrates that the PdM methodology is unique for each DHN according to the distinctive characteristics, environmental factors, heating resource type, available data, equipment, and other factors. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper presents the first comprehensive review focused on various aspects of PdM strategies developed for DHNs, including data analytics, prediction models, and integrated technologies to facilitate the implementation of these strategies in DHNs. A thorough discussion on state-of-the-art technologies and real-world challenges for implementing PdM is presented, and potential research avenues are provided. © 2024 The Author(s)},

One of the primary applications is to assist manufacturing plants in predicting product quality. Traditional predictive models primarily focus on establishing high-precision classification or regression models, with less emphasis on imbalanced data. This is a specific but common scenario in practical industrial environments concerning quality prediction. A SMOTE-XGboost quality prediction active control method based on joint optimization hyperparameters is proposed to address the problem of imbalanced data classification in product quality prediction. In addition, edge computing technology is introduced to address issues in industrial manufacturing, such as the large bandwidth load and resource limitations associated with traditional cloud computing models. Finally, the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method are validated through a case study of the brake disc production line. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other classification methods in brake disc quality prediction. © 2024, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Multi-fidelity matrices refer to a pair of data matrices, whose entries are the measurements of a specific physical quantity at different fidelity levels w.r.t. two environment variables arranged as the row and the column of matrices, respectively. Although a high-fidelity (HF) matrix can provide an accurate description of the physical quantity, it usually has a number of missing entries because of high acquisition cost. In contrast, its low-fidelity (LF) counterpart is complete but the accuracy of its entries cannot meet the actual requirement. Multi-fidelity matrix completion (MMC) aims to complete the missing entries of the HF matrix by fusing the LF matrix and the available entries of the HF matrix. In this paper, we develop a generative adversarial network for multi-fidelity matrix completion (GAN-MMC), which is composed of a generator and a discriminator. The generator input is the LF matrix and its output is the approximation of the complete HF matrix. The discriminator identifies whether the HF approximation completed by the generator accords with the real HF data distribution. A matrix data augmentation method is proposed to enrich the samples for training GAN-MMC. Moreover, a correlation coefficient-based term is also imposed into the generative loss in order to make the generator capture the relatedness information between the available HF entries and the corresponding LF entries. The numerical experiments show that the proposed model can effectively complete the HF matrix with massive missing entries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Digital manufacturing systems allow for dynamic production and maintenance planning adaptation based on internal and external evolving changes. In this context, data-driven predictive techniques can improve maintenance planning. However, dynamic production environments require the development of novel methods capable of efficiently managing the extensive data generated by manufacturing systems and processes while providing valuable insights for decision-making. Thus, this research proposes an integrated production and maintenance planning (IPMP) approach for digital manufacturing systems featuring a dynamic simulation-based optimization and a meta-learning-based failure prediction, which selects the best prognostic method to predict machine failures in real-time. The proposed model was applied to the Minifab case, in the semiconductor industry, providing a reduction of 20.9 % in lead time and 25.9 % in tardy jobs compared to setups with static dispatching rules and single-prognostic-method failure prediction. Such findings support the pertinence of the proposed novel approach in the area of production planning and control, contributing to the improvement of business performance, reliability, and competitiveness. © 2024 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

Data related to crack evolution and inherent strain during loading were obtained by monitoring the laboratory bridge slabs using potentiometers, strain gauges, and fiber optic sensors. Subsequently, a calibrated three-dimensional finite element model, representing different loading scenarios, was crafted, forming the foundation for the digital twins model of bridge slabs. The slab model was then integrated into a bridge span, constituting a digital twins model of the bridge span for load rating tests.

	abstract = {The theoretical study and experimental validation of a nonlinear shunt circuit for piezoelectric vibration damping is investigated here. The circuit consists of a resistor, an inductor and a nonlinear cubic voltage source. The shunt acts as an electrical analog to the mechanical nonlinear energy sinks (NESs). These mechanical NESs are passive vibration absorbers that typically have a cubic nonlinear stiffness. They have attractive properties such as saturation of the host system's vibration amplitude and strongly modulated response. This increases its operational frequency bandwidth and robustness against variations in the properties of host systems compared to linear vibration absorbers. However, the nonlinear nature may induce isolated responses in the host system that induce high vibration amplitudes. This paper investigates if these attractive properties also occur in the electric nonlinear energy sink shunt. An analytical expression for the frequency response is derived through the complexification-averaging method. Bifurcations in the frequency response reveal the occurrence of a quasi-periodic vibration energy exchange between the host system and the voltage over the electrodes of piezoelectric material. This is the main mechanism behind the amplitude saturation of the host system. Other bifurcations also reveal the existence of isolated responses. The nonlinear shunt is then realized with analog multipliers and a synthetic inductor and its performance in vibration damping is experimentally verified for a cantilever beam. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Then, a near-field source dimension reduction method based on fourth-order cumulants under nonuniform array is proposed to realize the separation and estimation of source angle and distance parameters. Subsequently, an acoustic emission source localization method based on orthogonal matching pursuit is proposed to maximize the source localization performance of the nonuniform linear array.

	abstract = {Due to its high efficiency, surrogate models have been extensively used in black-box-type engineering optimization problems. However, due to the nature of black-box functions, it is difficult to decide which surrogate model is the best for a given problem. In addition, it is difficult to accurately estimate the prediction accuracy of a surrogate on an expensive black-box function in advance. Because we cannot use many real expensive samples to test the prediction accuracy of different surrogates due to the limited computational resources. Ensembles of surrogates fully exploit the advantages of each surrogate model in predicting a given implicit function and have been shown to be effective in improving the robustness of surrogates. The use of ensembles of surrogates to the engineering design optimization has recently attracted huge attention. This work reviews the state-of-the-art ensembles of surrogates and their applications in black-box-type engineering optimization problems. We first familiarize readers with ensembles of surrogates, and give a description of different types of ensembles of surrogates. Further, the recent advances in using ensembles of surrogates for black-box-type engineering optimization are reviewed, and the applications in various optimization needs are highlighted. Finally, we identify the research gaps and most important trends. This review aims to serve as a comprehensive guide that enhances the accessibility of ensembles of surrogates, which can act as an insurance policy in predicting expensive black-box functions and are increasingly used in the field of black-box-type engineering optimization. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Deep Learning has been increasingly utilized in structural damage detection. Existing relevant studies often highlight the benefits of supervised deep learning in the intelligent identification of bridge damage. Notably, however, supervised deep learning methods encounter specific challenges in processing real-world monitoring data to reflect damage. Typical challenges include: (i) the need for a large dataset derived from a vast number of labeled damaged cases, which are extremely difficult to obtain from real-world monitoring data, experiments, and numerical simulations; (ii) the inability of available damage sample spectra to fully capture the damage information underlying the dynamic responses of bridges; (iii) the likelihood of requiring manual intervention to discriminate damage from the outputs of deep learning models, which is inefficient when dealing with massive amounts of monitoring data. To address these challenges, this study proposes an intelligent unsupervised deep learning framework for damage identification in bridges. The framework is characterized by three innovative technical elements: (1) a Deep Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) model with a hybrid loss function is developed to provide an intelligent system that can identify bridge damage without requiring a large dataset of damaged cases; (2) Wavelet transmissibility pattern spectra are established to characterize damage information embedded in dynamic responses in a more efficient manner; and (3) an Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS)-based damage picker is proposed to achieve automatic discrimination of damage cases. The feasibility of this framework is numerically demonstrated through the detection of damage in a curved bridge, and its effectiveness is experimentally validated on a laboratory-scale suspension bridge with induced damage. The results indicate that the proposed framework can automatically and accurately identify damage in bridges. This framework provides a solution for intelligent and data-driven bridge damage detection. © 2024},

	abstract = {Reduced Order Models (ROMs) are of considerable importance in many areas of engineering in which computational time presents difficulties. Established approaches employ projection-based reduction, such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. The limitation of the linear nature of such operators is typically tackled via a library of local reduction subspaces, which requires the assembly of numerous local ROMs to address parametric dependencies. Our work attempts to define a more generalisable mapping between parametric inputs and reduced bases for the purpose of generative modeling. We propose the use of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) in place of the typically utilised clustering or interpolation operations, for inferring the fundamental vectors, termed as modes, which approximate the manifold of the model response for any and each parametric input state. The derived ROM still relies on projection bases, built on the basis of full-order model simulations, thus retaining the imprinted physical connotation. However, it additionally exploits a matrix of coefficients that relates each local sample response and dynamics to the global phenomena across the parametric input domain. The VAE scheme is utilised for approximating these coefficients for any input state. This coupling leads to a high-precision low-order representation, which is particularly suited for problems where model dependencies or excitation traits cause the dynamic behavior to span multiple response regimes. Moreover, the probabilistic treatment of the VAE representation allows for uncertainty quantification on the reduction bases, which may then be propagated to the ROM response. The performance of the proposed approach is validated on an open-source simulation benchmark featuring hysteresis and multi-parametric dependencies, and on a large-scale wind turbine tower characterised by nonlinear material behavior and model uncertainty. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Earlier studies have shown that the pitch motion of the platform can enhance the power coefficient of offshore vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT), particularly in the realm of scaled model. However, there is a shortage of research employing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to evaluate how that motion affects the aerodynamic performance of full-scale VAWT. Moreover, the differences in aerodynamic characteristics between full-scale and scaled VAWTs are not well-understood. To fill this knowledge gap, we utilize high-fidelity CFD simulations to investigate the aerodynamic performance of a 5.3-MW full-scale offshore H-type VAWT in the presence of pitch motion. Subsequently, we conduct a comparative analysis of the variations between the full-scale VAWT and its scaled counterpart. Furthermore, we explore the influence of pitch amplitude and period on the overall performance. The findings reveal that, with low solidity (i.e., 0.1) and moderate tip speed ratio (i.e., 3.5), periodic pitch motion results in a 16.42% improvement in the power coefficient for the full-scale VAWT. In contrast, the scaled counterpart experiences a significant 56.71% reduction in the power coefficient. Meanwhile, for the full-scale VAWT, selecting a larger pitch amplitude and shorter pitch period holds the potential to enhance the power coefficient; however, the durability concerns stemming from the extensive fluctuations in blade torque need to be addressed. Additionally, it is observed that pitch motion introduces turbulent structures into the wake, facilitating both expansion and recovery. Due to the scale effect (Reynolds number effect), it's crucial to recognize that conclusions drawn about the aerodynamic performance of full-scale VAWT cannot be directly extrapolated from scaled model. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study examines the effect of novel photovoltaic (PV) panels called bi-facial PV on the energy planning and management of the proposed interconnected grid. Dual buildings are assumed to be different applications interacting with each other and the upstream network. Various renewable and non-renewable energy resources are considered, including CHP, boiler, wind turbine (WT), and electrical and thermal energy storage. The goal is to minimize multi-objective functions of total cost and contamination simultaneously. Bi-facial PV panels can also receive reflected light from the environment (depending on various albedo), resulting in an additional 20 % growth in produced power. The problem is formulated as the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and solved in GAMS software by CPLEX solver. The optimization problem is solved by using epsilon constraints method and fuzzy satisfying approach. In order to reach accurate results, the diverse demands of the proposed buildings and renewable-based units’ obtainable power are calculated using Energy Plus and Design Builder software. The study represents two scenarios in which mono-facial and bi-facial planning are exerted. The final results show that a 20 % increase in produced power significantly impacts the exchangeable power between buildings and the upstream network, leading to a noticeable cost reduction.

	abstract = {The increasing global population amplifies the demand for food and energy. Meeting these demands should be a priority and aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Photovoltaic (PV) systems are one of the key technologies for a sustainable energy transition. However, PV farms are space-intensive, conflicting with other land-uses such as agriculture. Agrivoltaics (AV) offers a dual-land-use solution by combining solar energy and crop cultivation. Some pioneering AV production systems have been implemented in practice. However, optimizing the PV technology and -array design as well as understanding the impact of PV panels on crop selection and performance remains challenging. Determining the best PV technology and minimizing shading's negative effects on crops can make or break an AV system. This multidisciplinary review combines the latest findings in AV research, PV array designs and module technologies. This review also compares the agronomic potential of various crops for AV and presents a meta-analysis of crop performance under varying shading conditions. Findings from this review indicate that (1) AV systems mainly rely on crystalline silicon (c-Si) cell technology, however, wavelength selective, or spectral shifting PV technologies and diffusion coatings or H2 panels provide future opportunities. (2) AV systems can boost land use efficiency. (3) Shading of crops in AV systems can lead to crop losses but can also provide shelter and enhance crop yield or quality in select climates. (4) Site-specific AV system design is essential to guarantee profitable operation. © 2024 The Authors},

Experimental results show that the FCG life and the crack growth retardation (CGR) effect of both steels correlate positively with the loading angle and negatively with the temperature. The prediction results for FCG path indicate that the Maximum Tangential Stress (MTS) criterion provides accurate predictions for loading angles less than 45° in low-temperature mixed mode (I + II), while the Richard model is more suitable for the loading angle of 60°. The simulation results show that, when the crack deflects, KII decreases rapidly in magnitude while KI gradually increases and becomes dominant.

	abstract = {The rapid advancement of intelligent theories and models, exemplified by deep learning, has achieved remarkable success across numerous fields. However, given that the complexity and variability of offshore wind turbine systems, particularly in the context of high-power variable-frequency control of insulated bearings in offshore wind turbines, the problem of fault identification has become a recognized technical challenge. Additionally, fully exploiting the temporal characteristics of insulated bearing fault data poses a key problem that demands urgent resolution. To address these gaps, this paper pioneers a novel Lightweight Temporal Feature-focused framework, named LTFM-Net, aimed at solving the difficult problem of identifying insulated bearing faults in offshore wind turbines in practical engineering applications. Specifically, this framework enables the intelligent identification of insulated bearing faults under harsh operating conditions such as alternating voltage and variable loads, marking a first in this field. Furthermore, an innovative strategy named Weighted Diminish Recurrent Unit (WDRU) was developed, along with the derivation of its backpropagation formula, which is innovatively applied to the feature extraction module of the LTFM-Net framework for the first time. Thus, an efficient method for acquiring fault data from insulated bearings in offshore wind turbines was proposed. Based on a unified dataset, the diagnostic performance of the LTFM-Net framework was evaluated and compared with seven advanced methods. The results demonstrate that the LTFM-Net achieves precise identification of insulated bearing faults, confirming its excellent generalization, robustness, and superiority. The introduction of t-SNE for visualizing the fault characteristics of insulated bearings uncovered by the LTFM-Net framework further enhances its reliability, accuracy, and credibility. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Shear wave velocity (Vs) is crucial for designing geotechnical systems subjected to dynamic loads, especially in seismically active regions. The shear wave velocity of geomaterials can be determined using in situ and laboratory tests. However, due to time and cost limitations, the Vs is not easily available in most projects. Various empirical models have been developed by researchers for predicting the shear wave velocity of geomaterials. However, most of these models have been developed for specific soil types and loading characteristics. In this work, for predicting the shear wave velocity of granular soils using various combinations of input parameters, various empirical models were proposed. Furthermore, machine learning (ML) methods were utilized to predict the Vs. The suggested models consider the impact of grading characteristics such as fine content (FC), gravel content (GC), median particle size (D50), uniformity coefficient (Cu), and coefficient of curvature (Cc), as well as void ratio (e), mean effective confining pressure (σm′), consolidation stress ratio (KC), and specimen preparation techniques for reconstitution of specimens. To achieve this, a series of bender element tests were performed on various sand and gravel mixtures. Furthermore, data from previous studies were also used. So, the study utilized 513 data points from laboratory element experiments conducted on granular soils. For predicting the Vs of granular soils, four empirical models and three ML models, namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), were developed in this study. The findings showed that the ANN model outperforms the other comparative models in terms of accuracy and error. While the empirical models may serve as useful tools for initial Vs estimation in construction projects, the study primarily highlights the significance of using ML methods to enhance the prediction accuracy of Vs based on the available soil properties. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Anomaly prediction is an important aspect of predictive maintenance for port machinery and equipment. Traditional anomaly prediction techniques process the raw time- or frequency-domain data, which makes time-series data difficult to reconstruct. In particular, time-series data with weak features, such as sensor data, are difficult to model. Furthermore, the absence of sufficient fault-labeled data for industrial processes means that classification models are difficult to train. Therefore, this study introduces an advanced temporal anomaly prediction model, which uses a gated recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder to process time- and frequency-domain data in parallel. The feature match and temporal consistency of the data are modeled using a bidomain competitive attention module and bidirectional loss function, respectively, which reduces the mean squared error (MSE) by 15.43%. Weak fault features in the sensor data are enhanced using dynamics simulations, which address the problem of missing fault labels by using a threshold diagnostic model instead of supervised learning. Thus, the recall rate is increased by 9.04%. An attention storage pool approach is also used to mitigate the prediction decay caused by external variables. Overall, the proposed method can improve the efficiency and safety of industrial machinery by addressing the challenges involved in modeling time-series sensor data with weak features.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In modern Internet of Things-enhanced wind power systems, most existing data-driven fault diagnosis approaches for wind turbines (WTs) are performed under a centralized paradigm that ignores data privacy. Recently, federated learning (FL) presented a solution to enable edge WTs located at isolated sites to collaboratively learn a shared diagnosis model without accessing local privacy-sensitive data. However, the practical issues of fault label heterogeneity among edge clients and scarcity of labeled data still severely impede the generation of a satisfactory diagnosis model. To address these issues, we propose a diagnostic knowledge-based FL framework (DKFLWT) for collaborative fault diagnosis of distributed edge WTs. In our DKFLWT framework, independently learned diagnostic knowledge from each edge client, rather than model parameters in conventional FL, is uploaded to the cloud server to enrich the client-specific information visible to the server and mitigate the adverse effects on model performance caused by label heterogeneity. To enhance the overall efficiency of the framework, we develop a two-stage, single-round training mechanism, in which the cloud server serves as a universal platform that can accommodate the customized requirements of users, implying the convenient integration of semi-supervised learning to enhance the diagnosis performance in scenarios with limited labeled data. Furthermore, a spatiotemporal memory-enhanced autoencoder is designed to sufficiently exploit essential diagnostic knowledge of different fault patterns from each client. Experimental results demonstrate superior diagnosis performance of our DKFLWT framework with an improvement of more than 22.1% in accuracy and 37.2% in training efficiency against several compared methods in all seriously heterogeneous scenarios. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is a crucial aspect of predictive maintenance for equipment. However, main bearings operate in complex, high-frequency vibration-prone nacelle conditions, identifying fault characteristics and accurately predicting the degradation process pose significant challenges. To address this, this article presents the first-ever research on fault diagnosis and prognosis based on historical vibration data from in-service wind turbine units with confirmed damages in a certain offshore wind farm. Proposing a tree seed algorithm optimized long short-term memory (TSA-LSTM) predictive model founded on the sideband energy ratio (SER) principle. Considering the distinctive structural configuration of wind turbines, fault indexes are extracted from the modulation component composed of the main bearing defect frequency occurring on both sides of the gearbox characteristic frequency based on SER. The time sensitivity of LSTM and the excellent global search ability of TSA were combined to complete modeling. This approach effectively captures the degradation process and achieves accurate fault identification. Through comparison, the superior predictive performance and robustness of the proposed optimization algorithm are verified, with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) lower than 0.228 and root mean square error (RMSE) lower than 0.014. Additionally, the exponential fitting can accurately describe the whole process of the gradual accumulation of faults over time until failure, facilitating RUL prediction. The results demonstrate that SER-based features exhibit higher sensitivity to early-stage faults and better fit the degradation trend, providing a promising solution for wind turbine main bearing fault prognosis.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This research presents a novel approach proposed for the monitoring of mooring systems in Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWTs), employing a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Auto-Regressive (AR) models. CNN finds broad application in monitoring intricate structures, as they adeptly handle noisy response data without necessitating profound domain expertise. The precision of CNNs relies on the extraction of meaningful features from input data, necessitating meticulous data curation and labeling for optimal computational efficiency and accurate estimation. Emphasis is placed on the preference for feature-rich small datasets over voluminous yet sparse datasets, aiming to enable CNNs to discern crucial patterns more effectively and mitigate issues such as overfitting and extensive preprocessing. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the integration of AR models, which serve to compress data and enhance damage-sensitive characteristics in the input for CNNs. This integration involves deploying regression models fitted to historical responses, parameterized with AR coefficients sensitive to damage, and further classifying severity using CNNs. The sequential nature of this approach addresses challenges such as vanishing/exploding gradients, particularly for extended historical data, while also attenuating the impact of noise and irrelevant information through data compression. The study explores the effectiveness of the coupled AR-CNN method in monitoring FOWT mooring lines, with a specific focus on two levels of damage identification: detection with classification and damage severity across diverse damage and operational scenarios. The modified methodology exhibits superior outcomes by conducting a performance analysis against traditional CNNs and other machine-learning methods, highlighting the potential of the AR-CNN strategy to improve the precision of FOWT mooring line condition monitoring. These findings underscore the AR-CNN strategy's potential to enhance the accuracy of FOWT mooring line condition monitoring. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The scale of offshore wind energy has been rapidly growing worldwide in recent years. Accurate assessment of the offshore wind energy potential and emission reduction benefits is essential to realize the ambitious targets for future installations. In this study, the Shandong Sea of China was selected as a case study, and the long-term offshore wind energy potential was assessed using ERA5 reanalysis data for the last 30 years, including the spatio-temporal variation and the technical potential of wind resources. An innovative approach to evaluate the technical potential of installed offshore wind farms based on deep learning, satellite images and ERA5 reanalysis data was proposed and applied to the Shandong Sea. The results show that (1) the highest offshore wind energy potential is observed in the northeast sea of Weihai; (2) the inter-annual variation of wind resources is relatively modest, with a pronounced monthly variability. The richest wind resources are found in the spring; (3) the electricity generation of wind resources is 12.66–30.53 GWh/year, equivalent to a reduction of 9.35–22.55 Kt of CO2 emissions; (4) as of 2023, there were 12 OWFs including 633 offshore wind turbines in Shandong Sea, generating 14,218 GWh/year of clean electricity and reducing 10,505 kt/year of CO2 emissions. The method proposed in this study is applicable to both small- and large-scale areas and allows for an accurate assessment of the electricity generation from installed offshore wind farms. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Modal parameter estimation of operational structures is often a challenging task when confronted with unwanted distortions (outliers) in field measurements. Atypical observations present a problem to operational modal analysis (OMA) algorithms, such as stochastic subspace identification (SSI), severely biasing parameter estimates and resulting in misidentification of the system. Despite this predicament, no simple mechanism currently exists capable of dealing with such anomalies in SSI. Addressing this problem, this paper first introduces a novel probabilistic formulation of stochastic subspace identification (Prob-SSI), realised using probabilistic projections. Mathematically, the equivalence between this model and the classic algorithm is demonstrated. This fresh perspective, viewing SSI as a problem in probabilistic inference, lays the necessary mathematical foundation to enable a collection of new OMA approaches. To this end, a statistically robust SSI algorithm (robust Prob-SSI) is developed, capable of providing a principled and automatic way of handling outlying or anomalous data in the measured timeseries, such as may occur in field recordings, e.g. intermittent sensor dropout. Robust Prob-SSI is shown to outperform conventional SSI when confronted with ‘corrupted’ data, exhibiting improved identification performance and higher levels of confidence in the found poles when viewing stabilisation diagrams. Similar benefits are also demonstrated on the Z24 Bridge benchmark dataset, highlighting enhanced performance on measured systems. © 2024 The Authors},

To mitigate the randomness and uncertainty of wind energy, and improve prediction accuracy, the butterfly optimization algorithm is introduced to optimize the parameters of variational mode decomposition and long short-term memory networks.

	abstract = {Rolling bearing fault diagnosis holds paramount significance in industrial field, as it is pivotal for ensuring the reliability, safety, and economic viability of mechanical systems. Most of traditional data-driven fault diagnosis methods rely on the availability of pre-collected data sets (containing various failure modes) as training data. Regrettably, such datasets may not always be easy to collect, particularly in critical industrial settings. Consequently, the applicability of data-driven fault diagnostic methods across diverse applications is impeded. In response to this challenge, this research introduces a digital twin-empowered discriminative graph learning network (DT-DGLN) for bearing fault diagnostics with unlabeled industrial data. The primary improvements of this study are twofold: (1) The creation of an elaborate and meticulous digital twin model for bearings. This model encompasses multi-scale Kinetic simulations of the operational parameters of the bearing and relies exclusively on the architectural attributes of the bearing and magnitude of the failure to deduce the vibratory system's reaction. (2) The establishment of a domain adaption-based framework based on discriminative graph learning strategy that facilitates the transfer of known intelligence from simulated signals to real signals. This framework enables efficient fault recognition in cases where knowledge is limited. Rigorous experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

An NP-hard optimization problem named Wind Farm Cable Routing Problem (WFCRP) models this task. Previous studies have proposed Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulations (MILP) and metaheuristics for the WFCRP. However, they faced difficulties in solving instances with many turbines. Hybridization is a widely-explored approach that has produced better solutions as it combines the best features of individual algorithms. This paper proposes a hybrid algorithm for the WFCRP that combines four state-of-the-art metaheuristics and a MILP formulation. The hybridization technique uses multi-agent and Particle Swarm Optimization concepts, where particles are cooperative agents that work together to find high-quality solutions. Experimental results on instances with up to 120 turbines show that the proposed hybrid algorithm outperforms the best algorithm from the WFCRP literature. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Maintenance planning is crucial for efficient operation of wind turbines, particularly in harsh conditions where degradation of critical components, such as bearings, can lead to costly downtimes and safety threats. In this context, prognostics of degradation play a vital role, enabling timely interventions to prevent failures and optimize maintenance schedules. Learning systems-based vibration analysis of bearings stands out as one of the primary methods for assessing wind turbine health. However, data complexity and challenging conditions pose significant challenges to accurate degradation assessment. This paper proposes a novel approach, Uncertainty Bayesian-Optimized Extreme Recurrent EXpansion (UBO-EREX), which combines Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), a lightweight neural network, with Recurrent Expansion algorithms, a recently advanced representation learning technique. The UBO-EREX algorithm leverages Bayesian optimization to optimize its parameters, targeting uncertainty as an objective function to be minimized. We conducted a comprehensive study comparing UBO-EREX with basic ELM and a set of time-series adaptive deep learners, all optimized using Bayesian optimization with prediction errors as the main objective. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of UBO-EREX in terms of approximation and generalization. Specifically, UBO-EREX shows improvements of approximately 5.1460 ± 2.1338% in the coefficient of determination of generalization over deep learners and 5.7056% over ELM, respectively. Moreover, the objective search time is significantly reduced with UBO-EREX with 99.7884 ± 0.2404% over deep learners, highlighting its effectiveness in real-time degradation assessment of wind turbine bearings. Overall, our findings underscore the significance of incorporating uncertainty-aware UBO-EREX in predictive maintenance strategies for wind turbines, offering enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and robustness in degradation assessment. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {With the development of offshore wind power towards large-scale and deep-sea, the safety risks and the difficulty of intelligent operation and maintenance of offshore wind turbine (OWT) during operation periods have increased significantly. Structural vibration response is an important factor affecting the safety and stability of OWT. Accurate prediction on vibration through environmental conditions and operational factors can identify the safety risks of OWT in advance, and reduce harmful vibration through appropriate operation strategy regulation. Therefore, a vibration acceleration prediction method of OWT structures was proposed in this research based on Harris hawks optimization (HHO) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Firstly, approximately two months of monitoring data from a 3 MW OWT were extracted to establish the database for training the machine learning models. Then, the key hyperparameters of XGBoost were optimized by the HHO algorithm and compared with other typical algorithms. Finally, the trained prediction model was applied to the regularity analysis of different conditions and long time series data. The analysis results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively predict the vibration acceleration response of OWT structures using operational and environmental characteristics, and has higher accuracy and stability than other methods, with R2 of 0.9715 and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.55%. Simultaneously, it also shows acceptable accuracy on the long-term measured data because the MAPE of chosen summer, autumn, and winter samples were calculated as 9.60%, 11.76%, and 7.21%, respectively. The establishment of the HHO-XGBoost vibration prediction model can be applied in the subsequent prediction of the vibration trend, which provides a guarantee for the safe and stable operation of OWT. © 2024},

	abstract = {Guided wave propagation (GWP) is commonly employed for the design of SHM systems. However, GWP is sensitive to variations in the material properties, often leading to false alarms. To address this issue, uncertainty quantification (UQ) is employed to improve the reliability of the predictions. Computational structural mechanics is a useful tool for the simulation of GWP. Even so, the application of UQ methods requires numerous solutions, while large-scale, transient GWP simulations increase the computational cost. In this paper, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based reduced order model (ROM), annotated as BO-ML-ROM, to decrease the computational time of the GWP simulation. The ROM is integrated with a Bayesian optimization (BO) framework to adaptively sample the data for the ROM training. The results showed that BO outperforms one-shot sampling methods, both in terms of accuracy and speed. The developed ROM, which is orders of magnitude faster than the original solver, is then applied for forward uncertainty quantification of the GWP in an aluminum plate and a composite panel under varying material properties. The UQ analysis reveals the higher impact of the uncertainties in the wave reflections. Furthermore, to compute the influence of the material properties on the predictions, a sensitivity analysis (SA) is performed using the variance-based Sobol’ indices and the Shapley additive explanations, where it is shown that the uncertainties in the elastic properties have a varying influence across time. The predicted results reveal the efficiency of BO-ML-ROM for the simulation of the GWP and demonstrate its utility for UQ and SA. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {As the demand for sustainable energy solutions grows, there is a critical requirement for continuous innovation to optimize the performance and safety of renewable energy systems (RESs). Closed-loop digital twins (CLDTs)—synchronized virtual replicas embedded with real-time data and control loops to mirror the behavior of physical systems—have emerged as a promising tool for achieving this goal. This paper presents a systematic literature review on the application of digital twin (DT) technology in the context of RESs with an emphasis on the impact of DTs on the efficiency, performance, and safety assurance of RESs. It explores the concept of CLDTs, highlighting their key functionalities and potential benefits for various renewable energy technologies. However, their effective implementation requires a structured approach to integrate observation, orientation, decision, and action (OODA) processes. This study presents a novel OODA framework specifically designed for CLDTs to systematically identify and manage their key components. These components include real-time monitoring, decision-making, and actuation. The comparison is carried out against the capabilities of DT utilizing the OODA framework. By analyzing the current literature, this review explores how DT empowers RESs with enhanced efficiency, reduced risks, and improved safety assurance. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Generalization remains a significant challenge in the application of deep learning methods, particularly in predicting mooring line tension for moored floating structures. The dynamic and complex nature of marine environments makes accurate prediction of mooring line tension a formidable task. Existing deep learning models, constrained by the data distribution of their training sets, typically perform well within the scope of these datasets. However, their limited generalization capability becomes apparent when confronted with unknown and changing marine conditions, resulting in a decline in prediction accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Domain Generalization (DG) model approach, which incorporates a distribution matching regularization term to the model's loss function, aimed at reducing distributional disparities between data from different domains. The proposed method was compared with existing Deep Neural Network (DNN) model method through validation with engineering case studies. The results indicate that the DG model method significantly surpasses the DNN model in terms of generalization capabilities. The mooring line tension prediction model developed herein holds potential for constructing digital twins, offering near real-time data support for moored floating engineering projects. This facilitates timely and accurate decision-making in response to environmental changes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

A generalized D-S evidence theory called complex evidence theory (CET), is tailored to model and handle uncertainty on the complex plane. Within this context, generating complex basic belief assignments (CBBA) in CET stands as a critical challenge to improve the decision level for CET-based information fusion. This paper proposes an innovative method for generating CBBA to model uncertainty on the complex plane. Initially, a complex attribute membership function is introduced to construct the model. Subsequently, the CBBA is generated by inputting data into this model. Based on this CBBA generation method, a new decision-making algorithm is presented. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed CBBA generation method and decision-making algorithm, they are applied in a classification application. Comparative analysis demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed algorithm in CBBA generation compared to other methods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Dynamic soil-structure interaction (SSI) is an important field in civil engineering with applications in earthquake engineering, structural dynamics, and structural health monitoring (SHM). There is an ongoing need for the development of numerical methods that can accurately estimate SSI parameters to model these systems. In this paper, a Frequency Response Function (FRF)-based model updating method is developed that can estimate the embedded length of foundation piles, in addition to the mobilized soil mass and stiffness, when a lateral impact load is applied. Knowledge of the embedded length of piles is very important for modelling foundation behaviour, and may not be readily available from as-built construction information. For example, if developing reference damage models or digital twins of foundation structures, full knowledge of the pile geometry is required. The work in this paper develops a two-stage iterative model updating method, which utilizes FRF data obtained at the pile's head as a result of an applied lateral impact load. The method uses information from the 1st mode of vibration to estimate the mobilised soil mass and stiffness, and subsequently uses information from the 2nd mode of vibration to estimate the embedded length. To appraise the approach, impact tests are numerically simulated on a number of ‘piles’ (numerical spring-beam systems) with varying length/diameter (L/D) ratios to derive FRFs, whereby the models have known length and dynamic properties. These FRFs are then used as targets in the model updating approach, which iteratively varies the properties of a numerical model of a pile to obtain a match in the FRF data, and subsequently estimates the mobilised stiffness, mass, and embedded length. The results of the analyses illustrate that by minimising the difference in the first and second FRF peaks between the target and estimated FRFs, the method can accurately estimate the mass, stiffness and embedded length properties of the test ‘piles’. The performance of the approach against numerical case applications is assessed in this paper, as the properties of these systems are known in advance, facilitating quantification of the errors and performance. The developed method requires further validation through full-scale testing to confirm its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. © 2024 The Author(s)},

This study aims to determine the leveled cost of hydrogen (LCOH) resulting from floating offshore wind power generation. Initially, we created a numerical model to represent the power curve for large-capacity offshore wind power generation. Additionally, we accounted for the variability in electrolytic cell efficiency by modeling predictions based on real PEMEC parameters using the Aspen Custom Model. The power-hydrogen quantity was then predicted using Aspen Plus. A comparison is also made regarding the transportation of gaseous hydrogen and liquid hydrogen. Gaseous hydrogen is produced through pipelines, while liquid hydrogen is produced using a modified Claude cycle and transported via trucks. Finally, a Techno-economic analysis was conducted, considering the net present value (NPV) derived from capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX) throughout the entire process. The analysis of LCOH indicated that the most economically viable option for the region with the lowest LCOH per kg is the supply of liquid hydrogen, priced at $11.04/kgH2. Our sensitivity analysis also reveals that while liquid hydrogen is more cost-effective at up to 250 MW, gaseous hydrogen becomes cheaper as its scale exceeds 500 MW because of its greater sensitivity to production volume. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The currently prevalent finite element analysis methods incur extremely high computational costs, failing to meet the requirements for real-time prediction of the assembly and multiparametric design of composite bolted joints. Proposing a methodological framework for rapidly predicting the assembly physical field is necessary. This paper introduces a stress prediction framework to enhance analysis and aid material parameter design. The framework is inspired by image processing and artificial intelligence drawing by analogizing the computed physical field results to the generated images. Therefore, the Bolted Tightening Generative Adversarial Network (BT-GAN), a cascaded generative model, is proposed in this paper to predict stress fields of the composite bolted joints during assembly. The model starts with data augmentation of the stress filed results from the finite element analysis in a super-resolution network, which realizes an integral interpolation mapping from coarse-grid to fine-grid results. Then, the results of the data enhancement are fed into the subsequent conditional generative adversarial network for learning. Similar to the text-guided image generation approach, the network learns to understand the physical mapping relationships between different parameters and assembly stress fields. Moreover, the network achieves higher accuracy in stress field prediction by extraction the understanding of multi-scale features through the skip connection and the attention mechanism. This method effectively learns the physical mapping relationship between multiple parameters and the stress field, applying a graph generation approach to end-to-end predictions of the field. Compared to the results of finite element analysis from the coarse-grid, the Structure Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of the cascaded generative network proposed in this paper has been improved from 0.584 to 0.962 and the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metric has been increased from 17.3 dB to 58.2 dB. What's more, the mean relative error on the maximum values of the stress field has reached 6.9%. The trained model takes only 6.1s to complete a single prediction, significantly improving the prediction efficiency compared with finite element analysis. It is compared with the other networks commonly used for physical field prediction and shows improvement in the metrics proposed in the article. By constructing such an end-to-end stress field prediction framework during assembly, efficient forecasting for the assembly of composite bolted joints can be achieved. This is advantageous for the digital twin modeling of the assembly lines and the effective control of assembly quality, providing a powerful tool for assembly design and analysis. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Current DPS implementations face challenges with sensor fault tolerance, leading to system unreliability and increased false alarm rates that can disrupt dredging operations. We propose a Hybrid Redundancy Sensor Fault Tolerance (HRSFT) strategy that integrates matching physical sensors (PS) with two distinct types of virtual sensors (VS) driven by multi-sensor association and time-series prediction models. The HRSFT employs a voting-cold storage strategy to address the false alarm issues commonly associated with single virtual sensor systems. Through experimental validation, the HRSFT strategy has demonstrated its capability to provide accurate replacement information during both single and multi-sensor failure scenarios, effectively managing abnormal sensor data and enhancing the operational reliability of the DPS. The implementation of the HRSFT strategy significantly improves the accuracy and stability of the DPS, suggesting a substantial advancement in sensor fault tolerance that could be applied to similar systems in various industries, leading to safer and more reliable operations. © 2024},

	abstract = {Proton exchange membrane fuel cells offer a sustainable solution to electrical power generation and combined power and heat applications, even if they still encounter durability and reliability challenges. Prognostics and health management (PHM) is a promising solution to enhance the durability and reliability of fuel cell systems by providing information on fuel cell health status, predicting future performance, and prescribing optimal operational actions. Generally, the PHM technique can be divided into observation, analysis, and action phases. In this review, the state-of-the-art fuel cell PHM studies concerning the three phases of the PHM method are summarized. Hybrid fuel cell systems composed of single and multi-stack are investigated. The paper covers the main degradation mechanisms of fuel cell key components and existing durability datasets in the observation phase. The study of defining a proper health indicator and prediction of future health states of fuel cells, namely, prognostics are reviewed in the analysis phase. The outputs from the previous two phases are intended to be integrated into the action phase for optimizing the operational decisions that are responsible for achieving durable and reliable fuel cell systems. The objective of this review is three-fold: (1) to put together the existing studies of fuel cell durability and reliability-related studies into a PHM cycle and summarize the development status of each phase, (2) to identify the research gaps in existing PHM studies, and (3) to provide future perspectives for fuel cell PHM studies to achieve the ultimate goal of enhancing fuel cell system durability and reliability. © 2024 The Author(s)},

To fully exploit the synergies between HPV-WEC systems without introducing additional equipment, a layout optimization strategy for HPV-WEC arrays based on the improved bald eagle search algorithm (IBES) is proposed. IBES combines the levy flight strategy with simulated annealing (SA) mechanisms to balance the trade-off between local exploitation and global exploration. To assess the effectiveness of IBES in optimizing HPV-WEC arrays, optimizations were conducted for arrays with 5 and 8 buoys, and IBES was compared with five other algorithms.

	abstract = {To optimize the operation of his wind farm, the farm manager needs to make precise diagnostic decisions for scheduling efficiently the maintenance actions. To assist him in this task, this paper proposes an approach aimed at designing a hybrid diagnoser model for two main goals. The first one is to detect anomalies at an early stage, and the second one is to provide specific deductions or explanations about the potential cause of the problem. In this way, the developed system can help the maintenance manager understand why a particular decision needs to be made. To do this, an original approach coupling the artificial intelligence technique with a discrete event system is proposed to diagnose, identify, and explain a probable source of a problem. Thus, the proposed method uses a hybrid approach consisting of two model blocks. The first block consists of autoencoder models to extract feature representation to diagnose the health state of the system. The second one is a discrete event-based model to create and visualize rule-based anomaly alerts and triggers to provide plausible explanations to the operator to improve his task. Then, this work introduces a methodology to jointly train these two models and learn all parameters of the hybrid diagnoser. It is shown how the information extracted from the neural network model is used to automatically construct the event-based model to explain the occurrence of an anomaly. The proposed system achieved significant results in explaining and detecting early five types of anomalies in wind turbine systems with accuracy up to 80%. The results demonstrate that the approach can deliver performance gains of up to 20% compared to standard techniques such as Long short-term memory and Random cut forest. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Deflection is a crucial health indicator, with excessive deflection causing issues such as tilting and reduced positioning accuracy. This underscores the necessity for reliable deflection prediction methods in LHDs, a currently under-researched area, essential for informing predictive maintenance strategies. This study introduces an incremental analysis method that addresses the impact of internal cumulative wear and lubrication degradation on deflection increase. It involves iteratively updating a multiparametric model to represent the cumulative wear process and utilizes an empirical model based on the Stribeck curve to describe lubrication degradation. To enhance accuracy, particle filtering (PF) is employed to revise friction coefficients derived from the empirical model. Experimental data from an LHD operating in a load-carrying mission validates the accurate and robust nature of this method, particularly when compared with non-friction coefficient revising counterparts. As a typical application case study for preventive maintenance, this method is utilized to simulate various scenarios of lubrication replenishment and quantify the effect of timing on LHD lifespan enhancement through lubricant replenishment. The results facilitate the optimization of maintenance schedules and offer a new approach for updating lubrication-related parameters in digital twin models of equipment-level products, in line with preventative maintenance strategies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In pursuit of energy-efficient solutions for air supply systems in steel plants, this study introduces a novel hybrid air supply system, amalgamating Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) and Excess Pressure Recovery (EPR) units. The system integrates an expander in the WHR unit and a gas turbine in the EPR unit, coaxially aligning them with the blower. A 4E model is established to evaluate the system’s energy, exergy, economic, and environmental performance. Results highlight R236ea as optimal, boasting a net power output of 1072.07 kW and an exergy efficiency of 35.62%. The WHR and EPR units contribute 73.36 and 26.64%, respectively, resulting in an electricity saving of 8.38% for the blast furnace. The minimum cost per unit of net power output with R236ea is 0.0229 $/kWh, with a dynamic payback period of 1.66 years. Compared to traditional electro-driven systems, the proposed system yields a 14.23% total cost saving. R1233zd(E) facilitates the largest net emission reduction at 202.86 kt per year, operating at an evaporation temperature of 84.3 °C. This hybrid air supply system demonstrates significant practical value, offering simultaneous benefits in energy savings, cost reduction, and emission reduction, suggesting a promising avenue for future research and development in air supply systems.

	abstract = {In response to Japan's ambitious pursuit of carbon neutrality by 2050, this paper investigates the potential for tidal power generation in the Seto Inland Sea (SIS), Japan, utilising high-resolution ocean modelling and an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) combined with GIS-based spatial analysis. The analysis incorporates a 100 m resolution tidal current and water depth layers from the ocean model. The criteria used for evaluation were divided into main criteria, namely, proximity to existing infrastructure, wave height, and shipping density, and subcriteria, namely, distance from ports, power stations, highly populated areas, and coastlines. The identified optimal locations include the Naruto Strait, Akashi Strait, Matsushima Island, Hanaguri Strait, Funaori Strait, Taizaki Island, Kurushima Strait, Obatake Strait, and Tsuwaji Strait. With a focused analysis of the Obatake Strait in Yamaguchi Prefecture, analytical assessments of potential tidal power were conducted by considering two tidal turbines, Openhydro and Voith. The results indicate a power supply for approximately 100,000 households and a reduction of approximately 198,000 t-CO2 per year in the most optimistic scenario. In a less optimistic scenario, with the installation of only 10% of the maximum capacity, a power supply for approximately 10,000 households and a reduction of approximately 19,800 t-CO2 per year are observed. As Japan targets carbon neutrality by 2050, this research offers vital and practical insights for policymakers, energy planners, and environmentalists, identifying the Seto Inland Sea as a strategic area for tidal power development, aligning with Japan's commitment to a sustainable and resilient energy landscape. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The major problems in the power system network of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) region include the utilization of substantial fossil fuels, which leads to significant emissions of CO2. Moreover, due to the depletion of fossil fuels, it is very difficult to manage the demand requirement of the SAARC regions, which leads to significant power shortage issues. These problems would be resolved through the integration of the substantial amount of renewable energy resources (RERs) that are available in excess in the SAARC regions into the power system networks. This will provide a futuristic roadmap to a sustainable and green energy environment in the SAARC region. In this regard, the SAARC region has devised a new plan to transform its smart grid infrastructure into the super smart grid (SSG), which would connect the SAARC countries using the high voltage transmission lines utilizing each country's substantial RERs. To accelerate this ecofriendly effort, the key objective of this review study is to evaluate the potential of the SAARC SSG for demand management and emissions reduction. This study provides a comprehensive overview of SSG technology, covering its technical background, management, power flow improvement techniques, power stability techniques, simulation models, and future steps for development in the SAARC region. First, the regional conflicts, energy deficiency, and potential of the SAARC region have been discussed. Second, a potential architecture of the SAARC SSG has been simulated. Third, a novel Markov chain modeling has been presented for demand management in the SAARC regions. The results and discussions section presents findings from simulations and models. The paper also discusses CO2 reduction techniques, including methods for capturing, storing, and utilizing carbon in biofuel. The study also discusses futuristic optimization techniques in SSG, including blockchain, federated learning, reinforcement learning, the metaverse, digital twin technology, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. The SSG challenges and limitations section summarizes the challenges and limitations faced by SSG. Finally, a roadmap to a sustainable and green energy environment for the SAARC power grids has been identified to support the implementation of the futuristic SAARC SSG. The results exhibited that there is a good potential for successful demand management and emissions reduction through the SAARC SSG. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

To address the aforementioned issues, this paper introduces an incremental semi-supervised learning (ISL) approach based on boosting efficient attention (BEA) assisted cyclic adversarial auto-encoder (CAAE), referred to as BEA-CAAE. The CAAE enhances unsupervised feature representation by simultaneously constraining the distribution of encoded features and aligning elements of the reconstructed samples through a cyclic encoding strategy. The BEA improves classical attention weights' activation strength to better capture vital information, thereby boosting the feature extraction capabilities of both CAAE and the classifier. The ISL employs a stepwise pseudo-label propagation strategy to incrementally filter high-confidence samples, enhancing sample and label utilization, and improving diagnostic accuracy under low label rate conditions. Experiments conducted on multiple test rigs with simple structures as well as large-scale rotating components test rigs that mimic real-world engineering conditions have demonstrated that the proposed method exhibits a significant advantage over existing semi-supervised fault diagnosis approaches in terms of fault diagnosis accuracy and generalization capability, especially under low label rate conditions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Digital twin (DT) technology is a powerful tool that accurately represents physical entities and provides real-time monitoring and reliability analysis capabilities for decision-makers and managers. However, modeling complex systems in structural health monitoring using DTs can be repetitive and tedious with existing approaches. To address these issues, we propose a new approach called the Parametrized Structural Dynamic Modeling(PSDM) method. This approach effectively parametrizes dynamic systems in structural health monitoring by leveraging Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to represent and analyze complex structural behaviors. It also incorporates model reduction and kernel functions. By integrating physics-based insights and advanced modeling methodologies, the PSDM method aims to bridge the gap between the physical and digital domains, enabling accurate and efficient analysis of complex structural systems. To verify its accuracy and efficiency, we apply the PSDM method to two engineering cases: the wing cantilever beam and the telehandler boom. The results demonstrate that the online computational cost of the PSDM method is lower than Finite Element Methods (FEM), thereby improving the computational efficiency of DT modeling technology for complex-large structures. Thus, this research presents a feasible method for implementing structural reliability analysis for engineering equipment. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Understanding cylinder-induced wake is pivotal in fluid dynamics, providing essential insights for the design and analysis of various structures, including offshore platforms, bridges, and buildings. To achieve fast and accurate modeling, this study introduces a novel reduced-order model (ROM) utilizing dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and an advanced deep learning framework, specifically an attention-enhanced convolutional neural network-long short-term memory networks model (CNN-LSTM), for predicting cylinder-induced unsteady wake flows. The DMD efficiently simplifies complex fluid systems while retaining key dynamics, thus significantly saving computational costs. By leveraging its combined strengths, the CNN-LSTM with an attention mechanism effectively captures complex spatiotemporal features. The resulting ROM accurately reproduces the wake processes around a cylinder (group), demonstrating high consistency with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solutions (coefficient of determination > 0.98), and showcases satisfactory resilience to a (Gaussian) noise level of up to 25 %. This study contributes a robust ROM capable of handling spatiotemporal dynamics, facilitating swift prediction of future outcomes using historical data, which is particularly critical for efficient real-time analysis and informed decision-making in dynamic settings, e.g., digital twins and predictive maintenance. © 2024},

	abstract = {The degradation process of mechanical equipment shows considerable disparities under varying operating conditions. However, most existing remaining useful life (RUL) prediction methods ignore the influence of operating condition parameters on its degradation process. This results in their poor generalization performance in RUL prediction tasks of mechanical equipment. Additionally, the sequential transmission mode is adopted in the traditional time series models, leading to slower learning efficiency. To address these issues, a multiple conditions dual inputs attention network (MCDAN) is proposed for RUL prediction of mechanical equipment under complex fault modes and operating conditions. The model can learn the long short-term dependencies between sensor data in parallel without distance constraints to enhance its learning efficiency. Furthermore, it can simultaneously extract multi-dimensional performance degradation features of mechanical equipment from sensor data and operating condition data, and establish a mapping relationship between features and RUL. In addition, the model can effectively quantify the uncertainty of predicted RUL, providing more comprehensive information. Based on root mean square error, the performance of the MCDAN model was evaluated on the FD002 and FD004 datasets of C-MAPSS. The results demonstrated that compared with state-of-the-art models, the prediction accuracy of the MCDAN model has improved by 14.03% and 20.48%, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The accurate degradation performance assessment of rolling bearings is very important for the reliable operation of mechanical equipment. However, most current research is limited to the full life cycle signals of outer ring faults. As a vulnerable part of the rolling bearing, the cage is prone to instantaneous fracture. When the bearing cage fails, its signal amplitude surges in a short time, so this poses a certain challenge compared to the outer ring fault analysis. To solve the problem, an improved CycleGAN model is proposed to generate the full life cycle signals of cage degradation across various measuring points. The dilated convolution is introduced into the generator to further expand the model's receptive field, which enables the model to capture mutation features of the bearing cage fault signal across multiple scales. And the adaptive learning rate decay strategy is applied in the training process to make the model more focused on fault stage characteristics. Moreover, a deep belief network (DBN) optimized with a grid search algorithm is utilized to fit the root mean square value of the full life cycle signal to characterize the bearing cage degradation rule. The real bearing cage accelerated degradation experiment proves that the proposed model can effectively generate the synthetic signals of different measuring points. Meanwhile, the optimized DBN model can fit the degraded data better than the existing methods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Based on the datasets, analysis of structural responses of the turbine blade and their possible shifts with respect to a change in the operating conditions, e.g. rotor plane tilting and yawing, are performed. A Bayesian Network model is trained to produce ranges of values and likelihoods of occurrence of abnormal structural response or the most likely damage in the blade from inputs of operating conditions. The numerical analysis showed that yawing and tilting of rotor plane has very strong influence on the performance of a wind turbine. The out-of-plane bending is the dominant mode of the rotor blade while twisting and other complex modes of displacement could be more significant during some operating conditions such as at high tilt and yaw angles. The Bayesian Network is capable of computing probability mass functions of mechanical stress or displacement of the blade given a rotor rotation speed and a type of damage or vice versa, identifying a type of damage given a measured stress distribution level. © 2024},

Herein, we develop hemispherical spring origami (SO) triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) (HSO-TENGs) for self-powered ocean wave monitoring. Optimization is performed using two approaches. First, swing machine experiments are conducted to investigate the monitoring performance of the HSO-TENGs regarding wave height and period with satisfactory accuracy. To increase power generation and monitoring accuracy, the internal inertia and centroid of gravity of the HSO-TENGs are optimized with respect to the structural parameters (i.e., magnet weight, hammer height, and external swing arm length). Second, numerical simulations are performed using the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method to determine the most suitable fixed condition for the HSO-TENGs for sensing wave changes. Subsequently, wave tank experiments are conducted on the HSO-TENGs to determine their ability to sense wave height, period, frequency, and direction. Tests related to supplying other sensors are also conducted. Eventually, the ability of the HSO-TENGs to monitor wave direction and spreading parameters is investigated in a numerical SPH circular wave tank. The results prove that the optimized HSO-TENGs can achieve powering and sensing through the same device. © 2024 by the authors.},

The power output of wind farms is affected by many aspects, such as wind speed, wind direction and aging. The simulation system can not accurately fit the real power system. To solve this problem, this paper builds a hybrid model-data driven model for grid-connected power system of large-scale digital twin doubly-fed wind turbines’ farm, which realizes real-time update of interactive feedback between wind turbine and power grid and reduces computational force requirements. At the same time, the virtual model matching real time with the wind turbine physical entity has higher output accuracy and meets the requirements of fine simulation. In this paper, each doubly-fed wind turbine uses the long and short term memory network (LSTM) to build a data-driven model. The wind farm architecture and the connected power grid select the common physical simulation model, and the digital twin technology is used to realize the two-way feedback of wind turbine physical model maintenance and virtual data model update. The example is tested by real measurement data, and the simulation results show that the digital twin model of the doubly-fed wind turbines’ farm has better fitting ability and accuracy than the traditional model under different working conditions, and realizes real-time updating ability of the virtual model. This model is helpful to exploring the fault of a specific wind turbine, the change of control mode, the wind speed fluctuation and other conditions in large-scale wind farm grid-connection, and is helpful to studying the influence of wind turbine interaction and grid disturbance on wind farm. © 2024 Science Press.

This has led to the proliferation of electrical mobility, including the wide-scale production of passenger vehicles, personal mobility devices and recent announcements regarding electrically powered aircraft, as well as in energy production. Electrical machines provide a cleaner source of energy during operation in comparison to their traditional fossil-based alternatives. The uncertainty and lack of transparency hanging over these green credentials can be attributed to how these products are manufactured and then disposed of at the end of their life. For them to be a truly sustainable solution, improvements need to be made across their entire life cycle. With the projected increase in their numbers due to the advancement of electrification, this current life cycle is not sustainable, directly opposing the intention of these products. This paper will introduce the current demand and challenges. It will also present these motors broken down into their constituent parts and follow each through their typical lifecycle.

The interactions among different PCs significantly impact the accuracy of system reliability assessments. To investigate the dynamic variations in degradation parameters in failure models under the influence of external factors and to explore the impact of interactions between different PCs on reliability during competing failure processes, this paper establishes a competing failure reliability model based on the correlation of multiple PCs. A degradation failure parameter updating method is proposed using an extended Kalman particle filtering (EKPF) algorithm. Additionally, the D-vine copula function is employed to describe the correlation between different PCs under competing failure conditions. Taking the hydraulic power unit (HPU) of subsea Christmas trees as an example, a competing failure model considering the correlations of PCs is obtained. Sensitivity analysis of the degradation parameters of external environmental conditions is conducted based on the updating of the degradation failure parameters. The study investigates the correlations of PCs and the impact of different shock intensities on system reliability. Considering these correlations, the model is extended to three different shock modes: extreme shock, δ-impulse, and m-impulse. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Due to increasing concerns about global warming, demand for renewable energies has increased significantly. Among all sources of renewable energy, tidal energy is one of the most efficient. In order to accurately simulate and predict tidal current (TC), a novel two-stage methodology is suggested in this paper which not only can benefit the smart cities, but also can help for a more fitting landscape design in offshore areas. The integration of digital twin technology in landscape planning facilitates a comprehensive understanding of renewable energy systems in smart cities, enabling proactive decision-making and sustainable development strategies. To extract the most desirable characteristics from the dataset measuring TC speed and direction, the suggested method uses a unique fuzzy feature selection (FFS) technique. The Long short-term memory (LSTM) is further trained for precise prediction using the chosen characteristics. In order to improve the performance of the LSTM, an evolutionary optimization technique is developed to train the parameters of the proposed model to reach the best training objectives. The efficiency and precision of the model are evaluated using real tidal data from the Qinhuangdao beach. The outcomes demonstrate the proposed model's suitable performance and excellent precision in contrast to other well-known techniques like shallow NNs and well-known linear techniques. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Advanced nuclear reactors offer innovative applications due to their portability, reliability, resiliency, and high capacity factors. To operate them on a wider scale, reducing maintenance life-cycle costs while ensuring their integrity is essential. Autonomous operations in advanced nuclear reactors using augmented Digital Twin (DT) technology can serve as a cost-effective solution by increasing awareness about the system's health. A key component of nuclear DT frameworks is the condition monitoring of safety systems, such as piping-equipment systems, which involves acquiring and monitoring the plant's sensor data. This research proposes a condition monitoring methodology utilizing deep learning algorithms, such as multilayer perceptions (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to detect degradation and its severity in nuclear piping-equipment systems. Sensor signals are processed to obtain the power spectral density and the Short-Time Fourier transform, and feature extraction methodologies are proposed to develop degradation-sensitive data repositories. The performance of MLP, one-dimensional (1D) CNN, and 2D CNN within the proposed condition monitoring framework is compared using a finite element model of a 3D piping system subjected to seismic loads as the application case study. Various approaches, such as dropout, k-Fold validation, regularization, and early stopping of training the network, are investigated to avoid overfitting the models to the input sensor data. The predictive capability and computational capacity of the deep learning algorithms are also compared to detect degradation in the Z-pipe system of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBRII). The Z-pipe system is subjected to harmonic excitations that represent normal operating loads, such as pump-induced vibrations. The findings of the study indicate that the proposed artificial intelligence (AI)-driven condition monitoring framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracies with a 2D CNN, whereas the MLP exhibits higher computational efficiency. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

However, as the increase of identification framework elements, the computational complexity of Dempster's rule of combination increases exponentially. To address this issue, we propose a novel quantum Dempster's rule of combination (QDRC) by means of Toffoli gate. The QDRC combination process is completely implemented using quantum circuits. To validate the efficiency of the proposed QDRC, we conduct simulation experiments on IBM and IonQ quantum cloud platforms. Besides, we implement the QDRC algorithm to the real quantum computer of IonQ Harmony. The experiment results show that the result of QDRC is getting more and more accurate as the number of measurements increases. In addition, we propose a quantum multisource information fusion method on the basis of QDRC.

The work focuses on designing a model for the computation of reliability and RUL of a spur gear pair that operates on three distinct terrains. The model is based on the Weibull distribution and pitting fatigue life of the individual gears. The entire torque range is divided into multiple intervals, each accompanied by corresponding speed intervals, rather than solely concentrating on a single maximum load profile. Thus, the total path covered by the gear pair in a time period consists of different terrains, each with segments of torque, speed, and residence time. The path generation and transition between the segments are done using non-Markovian and non-stationary transitional probability matrices obtained through the natural language processing technique of N-grams. The model, in contrast to pure physics-based fatigue life models, combines the benefits of considering various time-varying uncertainties of load, speed, and terrain, thereby increasing precision in estimating reliability and RUL. Additionally, the combination of the analytical method with N-grams in the current method is easier to use compared to complex mathematical models that employ crack propagation laws with finite elements, the boundary element method, etc. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Marine structures are subjected to cyclic wave loads in ocean environments, leading to progressive forms of structural degradation such as fatigue cracks. To ensure fitness-for-service of these critical assets, there has been increasing interest in the application of digital twin-enabled virtual monitoring techniques. Whilst numerous studies have focused on computational algorithms dedicated to virtual monitoring, little effort has been devoted to establishing a practical digital-to-physical connection and decision-making based on virtually monitored data. This paper bridges this research gap by proposing an approach for implementing digital twin-enabled virtually monitored data in inspection planning for marine structures. The inspection of fatigue-prone structural components plays a crucial role in structural integrity management. Reliability-informed inspection, which employs a probabilistic approach that prioritises inspections based on probability of failure, offers a cost-effective approach by avoiding unnecessary inspections and reducing life-cycle costs. However, conducting a comprehensive structural reliability analysis requires thorough knowledge of the actual operational profile and current state of a structure (e.g. consumed fatigue life) in order to accurately predict its future performance (e.g. remaining fatigue life). Although design specifications and assumptions can serve as guidelines, a high degree of uncertainty may arise due to the discrepancy between the actual operational profile and the design assumptions. The approach developed in this paper consists of four main elements: virtual monitoring, data-driven forecasting, fatigue reliability, and inspection planning. This provides a practical means for establishing a connection between condition monitoring and assessment in the digital world and decision-making in the physical world. An illustrative numerical example is then presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework. Finally, avenues for future research and developments in this field are discussed. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In the dynamic landscape of renewable energy, the primary goal continues to be the enhancement of competitiveness through the implementation of cutting-edge technologies. This requires a strategic focus on reducing energy costs and maximizing system performance. Within this framework, the continuous online monitoring of assets is essential for efficient operations, by conducting measurements that describe the condition of various components. However, the execution of these measurements can present technical and economic obstacles. To overcome these challenges, the implementation of indirect measurement techniques emerges as a viable solution. By leveraging measurements obtained in easily accessible areas, these methods enable the estimation of quantities in regions that would otherwise be inaccessible. This approach improves the monitoring process’s efficiency and provides previously unattainable information. Adopting indirect measurement techniques is also cost-effective, allowing the replacement of expensive sensors with existing infrastructure, which cuts down on installation costs and labor. This paper offers a detailed state-of-the-art review by providing an in-depth examination and classification of indirect measurement techniques and virtual sensing methods applied in the field of renewable energies.

	abstract = {With the development of digital technology, the maritime industry is under continuous digital transformation. For example, from manned engine room to control room and even to remotely controlled or autonomous ships. Maintenance has also changed from being a reactive or scheduled procedure to a predictive and proactive activity. Proactive maintenance relies on the condition monitoring (CM) of equipment. Condition Based Maintenance (CBM), Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) primarily focusing on three technical processes, namely condition monitoring, fault diagnosis and prognosis, and maintenance decision-making. Over the recent years, research has been on these topics through two main approaches: data-driven approaches and model-based approaches. Especially data-driven approaches with Deep Learning (DL) techniques have become a popular direction with successful implementation in different domains. Classification Societies are also developing new standards and methods with the industry to provide assurance of these emerging services. This paper presents a comprehensive review of state-to-art methods for PHM techniques for the past few years (2017–2023). First, a general introduction to different approaches with a focus on data-driven methods is presented. Subsequently, a detailed review of techniques applied to PHM is provided, where unique contributions, advantages, limitations and challenges are discussed. This is followed by a chapter that discusses the technical rules and standards from classification societies (DNV and ABS). The paper then explores the benefits, challenges, existing problems, and recommendations for PHM from the perspective of classification societies. Maritime stakeholders may find this article to be a valuable guide or reference for the development of such services. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Ocean wave spectrum is the key to the response estimation of seagoing vessel whose structural integrity is of utmost importance. Efforts have been made by researchers to correctly estimate the ocean wave spectrum using so called ‘wave-buoy analogy’ concept, where the vessel is considered to behave as a wave buoy. The aim of this study is to develop a methodology through which the directional wave spectrum can be estimated using the concept of ‘wave-buoy analogy’. To achieve the objective, ocean wave was modeled with 10-parameter bimodal wave spectrum combining long- and short-wave component. These 10 parameters of bimodal wave spectrum were targeted by solving non-linear least square problem, which is formulated by error function quantifying the difference between model prediction and onboard measurement data. Model prediction is based on the linear relationship between the wave spectrum and response spectra and measurement data are directly from the sensors installed on the vessel. To solve the non-linear least square problem, Bayesian statistics-based probabilistic approaches, Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCMC), were utilized. Well-known adaptive Metropolis–Hastings algorithm which is one of the most popularly used MCMC techniques was utilized to derive the spectrum parameters that best describe the directional wave spectrum. To validate the proposed methodology, pseudo measurement data generated by numerical analysis with different loading conditions were used. The application of the proposed methodology to the numerical analysis data confirmed that it accurately estimates the response at locations where sensors are not installed. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Japan Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineers (JASNAOE) 2024.},

	abstract = {The dynamic responses of key locations are important inputs for the life and reliability assessment of spacecraft structures. Due to the limited sensing resources, most critical responses are difficult to measure directly. A structural dynamic response reconstruction method is necessary. The responses of target locations can be reconstructed based on the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) of measured signals and the modal superposition. However, the structural modal information contained in the measured signal of a single sensor is limited, affecting the reconstruction accuracy. In this paper, a response reconstruction method based on multi-sensor data fusion is proposed. It is applied to a main load-bearing structure of a spacecraft and its typical components to verify its strain response reconstruction effect under random vibration loads. The experimental results show that multi-sensor data fusion improves the strain reconstruction accuracy. The maximum reduction in reconstruction error is from 8.7% to 1.3%. The reconstruction accuracy is further improved with the increase in the number of sensors. The optimal weighted fusion strategy for this problem is the weights defined by the Euclidean distance (EUC) or the dynamic time warping distance (DTW). The fusion results show a better performance with the increase in the power of the defined distance. The proposed multi-sensor fusion method improves the reconstruction accuracy via supplementing structural information to each other and eliminating the instability of single measured signals. More accurate dynamic responses via reconstruction reduce the large input uncertainty in life prediction and lay the foundation for building structural digital twins and managing structural health more effectively. © 2024 British Institute of Non-Destructive Testing.

	abstract = {Inter-turn Short Circuit (ITSC) faults in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) have gained significant attention due to the growing demand for enhanced reliability and safety in actuation systems. This paper presents a adaptive fault diagnosis approach specifically designed for ITSC faults in PMSM used in oil-drilling applications, where sparse actual data and varying speed conditions pose considerable sparse training data and ITSC feature extraction challenges respectively. To address these challenges, we first construct a physical fault model of PMSM-ITSC and establish a simulation experiment platform to replicate downhole environments with high temperatures and rapidly changing PMSM speeds, ensuring a reliable data source for analysis. Subsequently, we propose a novel adaptive peak-to-peak self-finding method (APPS) that leverages frequency-domain prior knowledge to adaptively extract ITSC fault characteristics, even amidst drastic changes in PMSM speed. Furthermore, we introduce the time-sequence efficient moving window self-attention network (EMWSAN) data model for inferring the stator phase winding state, incorporating Half-sandwich and Cascaded windows group attention operations. This approach significantly reduces computational complexity and network parameters compared to traditional self-attention mechanisms. To expedite the fitting process, we apply transfer learning (TL) theory, transferring knowledge from the physical knowledge to the data model, enabling EMWSAN to be trained more efficiently. As a result, our proposed ITSC fault diagnosis scheme achieves an impressive 96.72% classification accuracy, achieving existing state-of-the-art methods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Traditional approaches to the intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling bearings have predominantly relied on manual expertise for feature extraction, a practice that compromises robustness. In addition, the existing convolutional neural network (CNN) is characterized by an overabundance of parameters and a substantial requirement for training samples. To address these limitations, this study introduces a novel fault diagnosis algorithm for rolling bearings, integrating a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) with a support vector machine (SVM) to form an enhanced 1DCNN-SVM model. This model is further refined using the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) for the optimal adjustment of the parameters of 1DCNN-SVM. Specifically, by substituting the CNN’s final softmax layer with an SVM, the model becomes better suited for processing limited data volumes. In addition, the incorporation of batch normalization and dropout layers within the CNN framework significantly augments its fault classification accuracy for rolling bearings, concurrently mitigating the risk of overfitting. The SSA is subsequently applied to refine three principal hyper-parameters: batch size, initial learning rate, and the L2 regularization coefficient, thereby overcoming the challenges associated with manually adjusting parameters, such as extended processing times and unpredictable outcomes. Empirical tests on Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) datasets revealed the model’s superior performance, with the SSA-optimized 1DCNN-SVM showcasing diagnostic accuracies over 98%, marked improvements over conventional models, and a significant reduction in processing times. This method not only marks a significant advancement in intelligent fault diagnosis for rolling bearings but also demonstrates the potential of integrating machine learning for more precise and efficient diagnostics. The SSA-1DCNN-SVM model, optimized for accuracy and minimal data use, sets a new standard in fault diagnosis, relevant for machinery health monitoring and maintenance strategies across various industries. © 2024 Author(s).},

To enable rapid deformation assessment of storage tanks, this paper combines point cloud data acquired through terrestrial laser scanning with relevant data processing algorithms to construct a digital twin (DT) model. This achieves high-precision automated detection of tank deformation, facilitating the digital transformation of deformation assessment and offering an integrated detection strategy. First, Euclidean distance clustering is applied to the point cloud, and the point density within clusters is statistically analyzed using a Gaussian distribution. This results in a collection of point clusters within one standard deviation, effectively filtering out outliers and noise points, which facilitates the rapid global registration of the point cloud. Second, in order to quickly segment tank point clouds in the scene, back propagation neural network classification learning based on principal component analysis information is used. The point cloud model is combined with the fitting information of slices to generate a DT model, whose deformation can be evaluated through comparison with appropriate storage tank specifications, taking radial deformation, tank inclination, and foundation settlement as indicators. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {There are hundreds of various sensors used for online Prognosis and Health Management (PHM) of LREs. Inspired by the fact that a limited number of key sensors are selected for inflight control purposes in LRE, it is practical to optimal placement of redundant sensors for improving the diagnosability and economics of PHM systems. To strike a balance between sensor cost, real-time performance and diagnosability of the fault diagnosis algorithm in LRE, this paper proposes a novel Optimal Sensor Placement (OSP) method. Firstly, a Kernel Extreme Learning Machine-based (KELM) two-stage diagnosis algorithm is developed based on a system-level failure simulation model of LRE. Secondly, hierarchical diagnosability metrics are constructed to formulate the OSP problem in this paper. Thirdly, a Hierarchy Ranking Evolutionary Algorithm-based (HREA) two-stage OSP method is developed, achieving further optimization of Pareto solutions by the improved hypervolume indicator. Finally, the proposed method is validated using failure simulation datasets and hot-fire test-run experiment datasets. Additionally, four classical binary multi-objective optimization algorithms are introduced for comparison. The testing results demonstrate that the HREA-based OSP method outperforms other classical methods in effectively balancing the sensor cost, real-time performance and diagnosability of the diagnosis algorithm. The proposed method in this paper implements system-level OSP for LRE fault diagnosis and exhibits the potential for application in the development of reusable LREs. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The motion responses, mooring tensions, and submergence depth are the dominant factors for the arrangement of the Submerged Floating Tunnel (SFT) subjected to waves. Generally, the maximum values of motion responses, mooring tensions, and absolute submergence depth are mainly focused on. In the present study, experiments are implemented to measure the motion responses and mooring tensions of the SFT with different mooring patterns and submergence depths under waves with different characteristic wave heights and periods. In order to evaluate the arrangement of the SFT more effectively and comprehensively, besides the maximum values, several new characteristic parameters are introduced. Such parameters account for the motion responses in the frequency domain, the uniformity of the tension distribution, the length of time during which the cable reaches a relaxed condition during wave action, the KC number, the dimensionless period, the wave height, and the submergence depth. The results from the optimization analysis show the following: according to the characteristic values of motion responses and mooring tensions, the pattern of diagonal cables is better than that of diagonal cables + vertical cables; and within the range of the present experiments, there are optimal dimensionless parameters—the dimensionless submergence depth d0/LP ≥ 0.15, the KC number ≤ 0.8, or the dimensionless wave height Hs/d0 ≤ 0.10—for the condition of which the dynamic responses and mooring tensions vary slightly. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a systematic literature review on the application of digital twins in the energy sector. Initially, we generated an overview through a survey of prior reviews, independent of market vertical, then followed by a more detailed review concentrating on the power production and distribution domains, as per the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) smart grid standard. We implemented a rigorous method, which included seven stages, beginning with the collection of 2238 articles. We observed that the energy sector range was too broad and filtered by generation and distribution during the practical screening, resulting in 275 for further screening. This amount was then condensed to 81 papers that matched the quality screening criteria for synthesis and examination. In summary, digital twin architectures and frameworks include five components: the physical entity, bidirectional communication, the virtual entity (with modeling and simulation), data management, and services. Our study contributed by determining that distribution management is the most pertinent application of digital twins in the distribution domain and fault diagnosis in the generation domain. Furthermore, we found that digital twins involve multiple stakeholders whose role is rarely discussed in studies, and we identified a similar absence of emphasis for security. Research on security often presents the digital twin as an additional layer of protection, yet rarely investigates the security of the digital twin by itself. The potential limitations of our study to answer some of the technical research questions may be because of the criteria for the selection of papers. However, as the emphasis of this study is on the energy sector, it enabled domain-specific findings for generation and distribution. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Predicting a component’s fatigue life requires information on not only the number of stress cycles the component will undergo but also the kind and frequency of those stress cycles, as well as information about the surrounding environment and the intended purpose of the component. Models that can forecast lifespan by utilizing available experimental data are preferred since fatigue investigations are costly and time-consuming. Therefore, this work focuses on fatigue testing of S355 mild steel specimens under multiaxial loading conditions involving bending and torsion. The impact of phase-shifted loading conditions on material behavior, considering in-phase and with angles 0°, 45°, and 90°, has been studied. Then, the data of fatigue tests involve variations in loading amplitudes, and configurations used in different ML algorithms such as lazy k-nearest neighbors (Lazy-KNN), linear regression (LR), and random forest (RF) were employed for predictive modeling. These models are evaluated based on their ability to predict nominal stresses, torsion, and bending moments under varying loading configurations. The predictive modeling results are visually presented, showcasing the effectiveness of Lazy-KNN in accurately predicting material responses. Quantitative analyses further confirm the robustness of Lazy-KNN in predicting bending, nominal stress, and torsion under different loading conditions. The study provides valuable insights into the fatigue behavior of S355 mild steel and highlights the significance of considering multiaxial loading configurations in material testing and design. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.},

The research aims to comprehensively address the current and future aspects of DC, spanning from the distribution level to the utilization level. The renewed interest in DC power systems has led to the investigation of several transitional challenges in recent years. A significant portion of these efforts has been dedicated to determining the feasibility of applying DC to specific use cases. Additionally, the literature has explored design considerations such as system architecture and voltage levels, the integration of DC into existing distribution networks, load flow (LF) computations, and the distinct safety concerns associated with DC power systems. In this paper, the various research endeavors are categorized, evaluated, and scrutinized to assess the current state of the transition from a purely alternating current (AC) distribution system to a solely DC or hybrid AC/DC distribution system. A bibliometric analysis is conducted, constructing a network of co-occurrence based on author-provided keywords, which reveals the primary research foci in this domain. The barriers hindering the widespread adoption of DC distribution systems and potential solutions are also discussed.

	abstract = {This article proposes a proportional-integral-resonant (PIR) current control strategy for a wind-driven brushless doubly fed generator (WDBDFG) during network unbalance. Firstly, four control objectives of WDBDFG, including eliminating unbalanced currents of power winding (PW), pulsations of control winding (CW) currents, torque, and PW power, are discussed and different from current controls in which the references to PW currents were computed; the CW current references are derived here. Then, an improved CW current controller using a PIR controller is proposed to achieve different control objectives. In contrast with current controls, CW currents are not involved with sequence extraction in the proposed control and can be totally regulated only in a positive synchronous reference frame. Hence, the system control structure is greatly simplified, and dynamic characteristics are improved. Furthermore, in order to obtain completely decoupled control of current and average power, feedforward control, considering all the couplings and perturbances, is also applied in CW current loops. Simulation results for a 2 MW grid-connected WDBDFG show that the proposed control is capable of achieving four control objectives, including canceling CW current distortion, PW current unbalance, pulsations of PW active power or pulsations of reactive power, and machine torque. Its dynamic process is much more smoothly and quickly than that of current controls, and therefore the proposed control has better dynamic control characteristics during network unbalance. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Digital technologies can be used to gather accurate information about the behavior of structural components for improving systems design, as well as for enabling advanced Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) strategies. New avenues for achieving automated and continuous structural assessment are opened up via development of virtualization approaches delivering so-called Digital Twins (DTs), i.e., digital mirrored representations of physical systems relying on fusion of simulation models and real-time monitoring data. In this framework, the main motivation of the work presented in this paper stems from the existing challenges in the implementation and deployment of a real-time predictive framework for virtualization of dynamic systems. Kalman-based filters are usually employed in this context to address the task of joint input-state prediction in structural dynamics. A Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) approach is exploited in this work to construct flexible data-driven a priori models for the unknown inputs, which are then coupled with a combined deterministic-stochastic state-space model of the structural component under study for Kalman-based input-state estimation. The use of Gaussian Process (GP) regression for this task overcomes the limitations of the conventionally adopted random-walk model, thus limiting the necessity of offline user-dependent calibration of this type of data assimilation methods. This paper proposes the use of alternative covariance functions for GP regression in structural dynamics. A theoretical analysis of the GPLFMs linked to the investigated covariance functions is offered. The outcome of this study provides insights into the applicability of each covariance type for GP-based input-state estimation. The proposed framework is validated via an illustrative simulated example, namely a 3 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) system subjected to an array of different loading scenarios. Additionally, the performance of the method is experimentally assessed on the task of joint input-state estimation during testing of a 3D-printed scaled Wind Turbine (WT) blade. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study introduces an enhanced Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) control strategy for Direct Drive Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generators (D-PMSG) utilizing a Fuzzy Gradient Step Approach. By comparing with traditional MPPT methodologies, this approach demonstrates significant improvements in tracking accuracy, efficiency, and response time to fluctuating environmental conditions. The fuzzy logic control method adapts dynamically, optimizing power output under variable wind speeds. The comparative analysis reveals that our method not only surpasses conventional techniques in performance but also offers a cost-effective solution with less complexity. Implications of these advancements suggest potential applications in optimizing wind energy systems, enhancing the viability of renewable energy sources. By examining the relationship between Boost duty cycle changes and wind turbine output characteristics, a fuzzy gradient step hill-climbing search method is proposed to calculate the wind turbine output speed in order to improve the maximum power point tracking control performance of the direct-drive permanent magnet wind power generation system. The fuzzy controller employs the duty cycle of the Boost converter as its output quantity and its input quantity to accomplish the maximum power point tracking control of the wind turbine. A model was developed and verified through simulation for use in system modeling. The results show that the fuzzy gradient step hill-climbing search approach is more effective at regulating the maximum power point tracking control of the direct-drive permanent magnet wind power producing system than the traditional variable step-size hill-climbing search algorithm. This research paves the way for future exploration in smart grid integration and scalability of fuzzy logic-based MPPT controllers, marking a pivotal step towards sustainable energy solutions. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {High offshore installation costs are a significant factor limiting the competitiveness of offshore wind energy. One efficient installation approach for floating offshore wind turbines is to preassemble the tower, nacelle, and rotor onshore and perform a single lifting operation to mate the superstructure with the floating foundation at the installation site. It is heavy lifting, due to the weighty payload. At the end of the mating process, a loadoff operation is conducted to transfer the preassembly to the floating foundation. It results in a sudden change in total force acting on the vessel and causes substantial acceleration and potential damage to the mechanism in the onboard nacelles. The magnitude of acceleration of the onboard nacelles can vary greatly at different release instants. In this research, a simplified two-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) (heave and pitch) model is also proposed to account for the heavy lifting process and variable ballast tanks. The sudden payload transfer is approximated using a hyperbolic tangent function to guarantee continuity and differentiability. The loadoff operation consists of the decision-making and vessel-stabilizing phases. Based on the nonlinear model predictive control method, a payload-transfer time selector and anti-pitch ballast controller have been developed to achieve optimal release time decisions and stabilize the vessel after payload release, respectively. Six-DOF simulation results show that the proposed algorithms are capable to a satisfying level of robustness of deciding the optimal payload release time instant, as well as limiting the peak and mean acceleration magnitudes of the onboard nacelles after payload release. The decision-making and control strategies may promote the sustainable energy transformation by extending the operation window and reduce the installation costs. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Wind turbine performance is a critical aspect of renewable energy systems, and this study focuses on optimizing it through innovative strategies. It also discussed the different parts of WECS, such as wind turbines, generators, and control systems, to enhance their performance and efficiency. The research delves into the integration of speed control and Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) mechanisms using a sophisticated Three-Phase Interleaved Buck-Boost Converter. The converter's unique topology, involving a back-to-back connection, shows a pivotal part in shaping the performance of the wind turbine. Furthermore, the near-zero implementation in MPPT strives to minimize oscillations and enhance photovoltaic panel and wind turbine efficiency. This technique, as explored in various studies, aims to achieve stable, efficient power output by reducing perturbations, ensuring optimal energy capture, and improving overall system reliability. This study investigates the transformation before and after near-zero implementation in various contexts. It explores the impact on energy efficiency with near-zero properties, and the performance of buildings, providing insights into the substantial changes brought about by near-zero initiatives. Additionally, the implementation of MPPT is explored, demonstrating that adjusting delta values can lead to faster stabilization times. By changing the negative delta value to-0.0005, the system achieves stabilization at the target power of 19 kW within 0.2 seconds. These findings emphasize the versatility of the Three-Phase Interleaved Buck-Boost Converter in enhancing both speed control and MPPT for wind turbines. © 2024, University of Diyala.

	abstract = {The emerging floating vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) are regarded as a preferred solution to overcome the challenges faced by the traditional horizontal type in open-sea environments. Numerous numerical models have been advanced for assessing this novel object. However, current fully coupled models predominantly rely on simplified theories, assuming a linear fluid load and a one-dimensional slender beam structure. Despite computational fluid dynamic and finite element (CFD-FEA) coupling being qualified for high precision, this technology remains limited to the fixed VAWT field. To predict the load and structural response accurately and comprehensively, this study aims to extend CFD-FEA technology to floating VAWTs. First, an aero-hydro-moor-elastic fully coupled model is developed, and this model is validated by comparing it with several model experiments. Subsequently, a full-scale floating straight-bladed VAWT is simulated with the geometry and numerical models introduced. Furthermore, load and structural responses in a typical case are analyzed in both time and frequency domains. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of each structure part in floating VAWTs to environmental parameters is conducted and discussed. The discovery highlights the intricate nature of tower structural response, which incorporates 2-node, 3-node, wind frequency, and wave frequency components. Distinct from blades or floating foundations, which are primarily influenced by a single environmental parameter, the tower response is significantly amplified by the combined effects of wind and waves. © 2024 by the authors.},

This review systematically explores the existing literature on the management of photovoltaic operation and maintenance. Through the integration of bibliometric analysis and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, 186 articles are selected for further comprehensive review. The selected articles are examined and categorized into four interconnected research domains: maintenance strategies, performance indicators, degradation modeling, and maintenance optimization and planning. The presented analysis underscores the importance of integrating maintenance strategies to enhance system effectiveness. It also emphasizes the necessity of a systematic approach that integrates reliability assessment with economic and technical considerations to optimize maintenance planning and enhance system availability and resource efficiency. This aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy, while also ensuring grid security. Furthermore, the study identifies gaps and proposes avenues for improvement, recommending a shift towards prognostic approaches and the advancement of predictive maintenance in photovoltaic systems. Key suggestions also include customizing metrics for large installations, implementing adaptive protocols that move away from traditional component-centric scheduling, and using reinforcement learning to prioritize risk and optimize long-term performance.

Generally, it will encounter the challenge of constrained communication, high overhead, and high traceability demand, leading to the efficient remote process tracking issue. Existing approaches can address the issue by monitoring or simulating remote task execution. Nevertheless, they do not provide a cost-effective solution, especially when unexpected situation occurs. Thus, we proposed a new cloud-edge collaboration framework for process DT generation. It addresses the efficient remote process tracking issue with a real-virtual collaborative process tracking (RVCPT) approach. The approach contains three patterns of real-virtual collaboration for tracking the entire process of task execution with a coevolution pattern, identifying unexpected situations with a discrimination pattern, and generating a process DT with a real-virtual fusion pattern. This approach can minimize tracking overhead, and meanwhile maintains high traceability, which maximizes the overall cost-effectiveness. With prototype development, case study and experimental evaluation show the applicability and performance advantage of the new cloud-edge collaboration framework in remote supervision.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Monitoring health condition of offshore jacket platforms is crucial to prevent unexpected structural damages, where a prevailing challenge involves translating available feature information into structural damage patterns. Although the artificial neural network (ANN) models are popular in addressing this challenge, they often fail to capture the temporal correlations between the feature information and the damage patterns, which reduce their capability for discovering the laws governing the structural damage detection. To bridge this research gap, this study proposes a novel ensemble deep learning model to enhance the temporal feature extraction to improve the damage pattern identification. In this approach, a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) extracts the spatiotemporal features from the structural vibration measurements. Simultaneously, a SENet attention mechanism is introduced to select the most informatic features. Subsequently, a bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM) is employed to learn the mapping between the extracted features and the structural damage patterns. Furthermore, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the BiLSTM hyperparameters to enhance its stability and reliability. Both simulations and experiments are carried out to collect the vibration responses of the offshore jacket structure in different damage scenarios. The analysis results demonstrate that the proposed method produces remarkable improvement with respect to the accuracy and robustness in identifying the structural damages when compared with the ANNs. The overall detection accuracy of the proposed CNN-BiLSTM-Attention ensemble model is beyond 95%, which provides strong applicability to practical structural health monitoring of offshore platforms. © 2024 The Authors},

However, wind power has characteristics such as randomness and volatility, and its grid connection challenges the pressure of system peak shaving, making it increasingly difficult to regulate the power system. To solve the problem of wind power abandonment, the positive and negative peak shaving characteristics of wind power were first analyzed. Based on this, it is proposed that demand response resources and energy storage with adjustable characteristics are used as the new means of wind power consumption. Together with the thermal power units, they participate in the optimization and scheduling of the power grid, forming a coordinated and optimized operation mode of source load storage. With the goal of minimizing system operating costs, a two-stage economic scheduling model was formed for the day-ahead and intra-day periods. Finally, optimization software was used to solve the problem, and the simulation results showed the effectiveness of the proposed economic scheduling model, which can improve the system’s new energy consumption and reduce the system’s operating costs. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The escalating demand for electricity, driven by the confluence of population growth, technological advancements, and economic progress, has precipitated an energy shortfall within the smart city landscape. In addressing this challenge, smart city enterprises are strategically deploying smart grids to implement innovative Demand Response (DR) programs. These initiatives aim to optimize energy consumption by incentivizing citizens through public–private partnerships and exploring financing avenues like green bonds, thereby fostering sustainable and resilient urban energy ecosystems. The initial contribution of this paper introduces an energy management (EM) approach. An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) procedure is implemented to address the comprehensive planning problem across three researches: one without SOLAR batteries, one with SOLAR systems, and one incorporating SOLAR batteries. The model aims to decrease energy prices, mitigate peak-load, reduce carbon dioxide discharges, and prevent rebound peaks, ultimately enhancing user comfort. Simulations are conducted to match the efficacy of this proposed approach with obtainable ways. The results demonstrate that the recommended ACO procedure effectively reduces energy prices, carbon dioxide discharges, and peak loads across various researches. Consequently, this ACO procedure-based EM routine outperforms existing benchmark approaches. Meanwhile, digital twin (DT) technology is reshaping the renewable energy sector by offering virtual replicas of physical systems. This article delves into the applications, advantages, and challenges associated with digital twin modeling in renewable energy. The technology entails the creation of virtual replicas for renewable energy systems, integrating real-time data to facilitate precise simulation. Key advantages encompass accurate prediction, dynamic monitoring, and the optimization of energy production. The synergy between digital twin modeling and smart grids enhances flexibility and bolsters grid reliability. Nevertheless, challenges include ensuring data security, managing system interconnectivity, and addressing computational demands. In essence, digital twin modeling presents a pathway for realistic representation and efficient management of renewable energy, although challenges must be navigated to unleash its full potential. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

The paper focuses on studying the dynamic responses of the proposed Spar-type floating two-bladed wind turbine with a flexible hub connection at rated and extreme environmental conditions.

	abstract = {In mixed elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL), the load distribution between the gear meshing surfaces is shared by the oil film and the asperities of the gear's rough surface. Based on the load-sharing concept, this paper proposes a time-varying meshing stiffness (TVMS) model for gears with mixed EHL. The initial step involves the utilization of the Greenwood-Williamson model to calculate the contact stiffness of surface asperities, while the lubricating film is assessed using a curve-fitting formula to investigate the influence of gear surface morphology on TVMS. Subsequently, the incorporation of gear fillet foundation deformation and friction enables accurate TVMS determination. The proposed method is employed to examine the meshing stiffness of the gear pair under both dry lubrication and EHL conditions. Comparative analysis reveals favorable agreement between the proposed model and experimental results obtained under dry lubrication, thereby highlighting the superior performance of the proposed approach. Moreover, the time-varying friction coefficient under EHL is computed, and the impacts of gear surface morphology parameters, temperature, speed, and load on lubrication conditions and TVMS are investigated. The findings presented in this paper contribute significantly to advancements in gear design and performance. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {The climate emergency has prompted rapid and intensive research into sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy alternatives. Offshore wind has developed and exceeded all expectations over the last 2 decades and is now a central pillar of the UK and other international strategies to decarbonise energy systems. As the dependence on variable renewable energy resources increases, so does the importance of the necessity to develop energy storage and nonelectric energy vectors to ensure a resilient whole-energy system, also enabling difficult-to-decarbonise applications, e.g. heavy industry, heat, and certain areas of transport. Offshore wind and marine renewables have enormous potential that can never be completely utilised by the electricity system, and so green hydrogen has become a topic of increasing interest. Although numerous offshore and marine technologies are possible, the most appropriate combinations of power generation, materials and supporting structures, electrolysers, and support infrastructure and equipment depend on a wide range of factors, including the potential to maximise the use of local resources. This paper presents a critical review of contemporary offshore engineering tools and methodologies developed over many years for upstream oil and gas (O&G), maritime, and more recently offshore wind and renewable energy applications and examines how these along with recent developments in modelling and digitalisation might provide a platform to optimise green hydrogen offshore infrastructure. The key drivers and characteristics of future offshore green hydrogen systems are considered, and a SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat) analysis is provided to aid the discussion of the challenges and opportunities for the offshore green hydrogen production sector.  © Copyright: },

	abstract = {Efficient and accurate prediction of the wind turbine dynamic wake is crucial for active wake control and load assessment in wind farms. This paper proposes a real-time dynamic wake prediction model for wind turbines based on a physics-guided neural network. The model can predict the instantaneous dynamic wake field under various operating conditions using only the inflow wind speed as input. The model utilizes Taylor’s frozen-flow hypothesis and a steady-state wake model to convert instantaneous inflow wind speed and turbine parameters into neural network input features. A deep convolutional neural network then maps these features to desired wake field snapshots, enabling dynamic wake predictions for wind turbines. To train the model, we generated approximately 255 000 instantaneous flow field snapshots of single-turbine wakes using the large eddy simulation, covering different thrust coefficients and yaw angles. The model was trained using the supervised learning method and verified on the test set. The results indicate that the model can effectively predict the dynamic wake characteristics, including the dynamic wake meandering and the wake deflection of the yawed turbines. The model can also assess both the instantaneous wake velocity and the instantaneous wake center of a wind turbine. At a thrust coefficient of 0.75, the root mean square error for the predicted instantaneous wake velocity is around 6.53%, while the Pearson correlation coefficient for the predicted instantaneous wake center can reach 0.624. Furthermore, once the model is trained, its prediction accuracy does not decrease with the increase in the time span. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Digital Twin technology has emerged to become a key enabling technology in the ongoing transition into Industry 4.0. A Digital Twin is in essence a digital representation of an asset that provides better insight into its dynamics by combining a priori knowledge of the system through mathematical models with online data acquired from sensors and instruments deployed in or at the physical asset. While the technology is seeing increased use across several different industrial, governmental and research sectors, and across scientific disciplines, its application within aquaculture is still in its infancy. However, due to the rapid ongoing development in technological methods in aquaculture, an increasing number of the building blocks required to make a Digital Twin for aquaculture purposes are becoming available. We set out to explore these possibilities by first defining a Digital Twin — what components it should contain, how it should be constructed, and outlining the capability levels of a finished Digital Twin. Our next step was then to explore the state-of-the-art within the different required components and enabling technologies within aquaculture, thereby identifying the current foundation for developing Digital Twin technology in this sector. Following this, we developed concrete case studies that elaborate upon how we by combining existing and developing new technological tools could envision developing Digital Twins for three application areas of high industrial relevance, namely oxygen conditions in sea-cages, fish growth in sea-cages and in-cage robotics and vehicle operations. In conclusion, we present our thoughts on the potential of Digital Twin technology in being a key component in ushering in Industry 4.0 in aquaculture, and outline a pathway on the way onward towards achieving this goal. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Detecting bearing faults helps ensure the healthy operation of machinery and prevents serious accidents. However, fault diagnosis method based on deep learning relies on the correlation between the extracted vibration signal features. It does not consider the causal relationship between fault, noise, and vibration waveform changes, resulting in lower bearing fault diagnosis accuracy under realistic working conditions. This study proposes a graph neural network (GNN) method based on the Granger causality test for bearing fault detection called GCT-GNN to address this issue. The proposed method first performs feature transformation on the original signals to extract time-domain and frequency-domain features, forming a feature matrix. Then, spectral analysis is conducted on both faulty signals with noise and healthy signals to calculate the lag order between them. Subsequently, the Granger causality test is employed to quantify the impact of faults and noise on signal changes, and the quantified results are used to calculate weights, constructing an adjacency matrix. The completed adjacency matrix and feature matrix are input into the GNN for feature mapping, last classifying the bearing fault data. In this paper, five models, Deep residual shrinkage Network (DRSN), GNN, Support Vector Machines(SVM), Random Forests (RF), and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) were selected, and comparative experiments were carried out on two public data sets. The results show that, compared with other models, GCT-GNN has better anti-noise ability and is better than other models in various fault diagnoses. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Moving into the third decade of the 21st century, smart cities are becoming a vital concept of advancement of the quality of life. Without any doubt, cities today can generate data of high velocity which can be used in plethora of applications. The wind flow inside a city is an area of several studies which span from pedestrian comfort and natural ventilation to wind energy yield. We propose a Visual Analytics platform based on a server-client web architecture capable of identifying areas with high wind energy potential by employing 3D technologies and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards. The assessment of a whole city or sub-regions will be supported by integrating Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) outcomes with historical wind sensor readings. The results, in 3D space, of such analysis could be used by a wide audience, including city planners and citizens, for locating installation points of small-scale horizontal or vertical axis wind turbines in an urban area. The implementation presents various flows for spatio-temporal data processing. A number of evaluation plans assess the system performance.

	abstract = {Understanding component criticality in machinery performance degradation is important in ensuring the reliability and availability of ship systems, particularly considering the nature of ship operations requiring extended voyage periods, usually traversing regions with multiple climate and environmental conditions. Exposing the machinery system to varying degrees of load and operational conditions could lead to rapid degradation and reduced reliability. This research proposes a tailored solution by identifying critical components, the root causes of maintenance delays, understanding the factors influencing system reliability, and recognising failure-prone components. This paper proposes a hybrid approach using reliability analysis tools and machine learning. It uses dynamic fault tree analysis (DFTA) to determine how reliable and important a system is, as well as Bayesian belief network (BBN) availability analysis to assist with maintenance decisions. Furthermore, we developed an artificial neural network (ANN) fault detection model to identify the faults responsible for system unreliability. We conducted a case study on a ship power generation system, identifying the components critical to maintenance and defects contributing to such failures. Using reliability importance measures and minimal cut sets, we isolated all faults contributing over 40% of subsystem failures and related events. Among the 4 MDGs, the lubricating system had the highest average availability of 67%, while the cooling system had the lowest at 38% using the BBN availability outcome. Therefore, the BBN DSS recommended corrective action and ConMon as maintenance strategies due to the frequent failures of certain critical parts. ANN found overheating when MDG output was above 180 kVA, linking component failure to generator performance.

The digital twin transforms solely strain data from a strain-interfaced welded plate joint specimen to the load–displacement curve to compute cyclic J-integral values using the η approach, eliminating the need for load and displacement measurements. The accurate computation of the elasto-plastic ΔJ effectively extends the fatigue crack growth relationship derived from standard fracture specimens. The extended fatigue crack growth relationship accurately predicts the fatigue life of specimens under separate step-up and step-down variable amplitude loading regimes. © 2024 The Author(s)},

The research methodology employed in this study is experimental. The turbine design incorporates 0.3 mm thick transparent PVC as the material for the turbine blades, with a configuration featuring three helical-shaped blades measuring 93 cm in length, 16 cm in width, and having an 8 cm radius. The turbine frame is constructed using 20 mm×20 mm aluminum profiles, with dimensions of 100 cm in length, 30 cm in width, and 35 cm in height. Data collection involves conducting 10 repetitions for each wind speed variation ranging from 1 m/s to 10 m/s. The highest power output increase occurred at a wind speed of 6 m/s, with a power of 0.46 Watt increasing by 0.13 Watt. It resulted in an average shaft rotation of 132.28 rpm, average power output of 0.27 Watt, and average efficiency of 7.10% for wind speed variations ranging from 2 m/s to 6 m/s. © 2024 Author(s).},

	abstract = {The offshore wind sector is moving into deep waters and using floating platforms to harness the higher wind speeds in exposed locations. There are various floating platform types currently in development, but semi-submersibles are considered the most prominent early movers. Such floaters need to be towed to and from wind farm locations for installation, special cases of repair and decommissioning. As with any other offshore activity, metocean limits exist for towing operations which can impact the development of a wind farm. It is important to calculate the motion and loads of the platform before commencing the towing operations and to check whether they exceed the defined limits to enable safe execution. In this paper, two approaches using two different numerical tools to predict the motion of a fully assembled floating wind platform under tow are presented and compared. A potential flow-based method derived from a low forward speed approach and a hybrid approach combining potential flow and Morison equation methods are investigated, and the numerical predictions are compared and validated against experimental results. Both methods demonstrate accurate predictions, depending on the wave condition and towing speed, albeit differing in execution time and the simplicity of the simulation setup. The first method was found to provide good predictions of the motion in low-speed (0.514–1.543 m/s) towing conditions. The second method provides better results for all the towing speeds and wave heights. As the wave height and towing speed increase, deviations from experiments were observed, signifying non-linear phenomena that are difficult to analyse using the mentioned potential-flow-based methods. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The future of wind power systems deployment is in the form of wind farms comprised of scores of such large turbines, most likely at offshore locations. Individual turbines have grown in span from a few tens of meters to today’s large turbines with rotor diameters that dwarf even the largest commercial aircraft. These massive dynamical systems present unique challenges at scales unparalleled in prior applications of wind science research. Fundamental to this effort is the understanding of the wind turbine wake and its evolution. Furthermore, the optimization of the entire wind farm depends on the evolution of the wakes of different turbines and their interactions within the wind farm. In this article, we use the capabilities of the Common ODE Framework (CODEF) model for the analysis of the effects of wake–rotor and wake-to-wake interactions between two turbines situated in a tandem layout fully and partially aligned with the incoming wind. These experiments were conducted in the context of a research project supported by the National Rotor Testbed (NRT) program of Sandia National Labs (SNL). Results are presented for a layout which emulates the turbine interspace and relative turbine emplacement found at SNL’s Scaled Wind Technologies Facility (SWiFT), located in Lubbock, Texas. The evolution of the twin-wake interaction generates a very rich series of secondary transitions in the vortex structure of the combined wake. These ultimately affect the wake’s axial velocity patterns, altering the position, number, intensity, and shape of localized velocity-deficit zones in the wake’s cross-section. This complex distribution of axial velocity patterns has the capacity to substantially affect the power output, peak loads, fatigue damage, and aeroelastic stability of turbines located in subsequent rows downstream on the farm. © 2024 by the authors.},

An Euler backward time discretization method has been developed for the continuous-time sliding-mode controller to achieve a chattering-free implementation. The properties of the sliding-mode controller under the developed time discretization method e.g., finite-time convergence, and gain insensitivity have been studied analytically. In order to evaluate the developed sliding-mode control law under the discretization method, three known control strategies, i.e., gain-scheduling proportional-integral control, fuzzy control, and feedforward compensator strategies have been designed for the system. Some remarks are also given for the differentiator selection used to estimate the velocity.

This often results in significant fatigue damage, a primary concern in ocean engineering. Recent advancements in digital technologies, notably the concept of the digital twin, have revolutionized this field, significantly enhancing the intelligence and efficiency of structural operation and maintenance. This paper presents an innovative four-dimensional digital twin framework, meticulously designed for the fatigue damage assessment of semi-submersible platforms. We provide an in-depth examination of the critical technologies pertinent to each dimension and elucidate the intricate interplay of data flow amongst them. A key highlight of this study is the introduction of an advanced stress twinning methodology. This novel approach adeptly integrates real-time monitoring data with the results of high-fidelity numerical simulations. To validate the applicability and efficacy of this framework, it was implemented on a deep-water semi-submersible platform in the South China Sea.

	abstract = {Digital twin (DT) technology provides a path for implementing cyber–physical systems (CPS) and developing smart manufacturing because they are essential tools for monitoring and controlling manufacturing processes. It is considered a vital technology in smart manufacturing and is being widely researched in academia and industry. Furthermore, the combination of DTs and immersive environments has shown great potential for integrating novel capabilities into the new generation of CPS. This research presents an architecture for implementing immersive digital twins under ISO 23247 in flexible manufacturing processes. The proposed system is based on the integration of DT technologies in conjunction with augmented reality (AR) and gesture tracking, and validation was performed in the sorting station of the MPS 500 to increase the interaction and flexibility between physical and virtual environments in real time, thus enhancing the capabilities of the DT. The methodology used for the design and implementation of the DT includes (1) general principles and requirements; (2) models with functional views based on domains and entities; (3) attributes of the observable manufacturing elements; and (4) protocols for the exchange of information between entities. The results show that the integration of these technologies improves the monitoring, control, and simulation capabilities of processes using 3D resources and immersive environments, achieving a higher level of interactivity. In addition, error detection tests were carried out, where a reduction of time was observed in the resolution of errors that may be caused by internal or external disturbances of the process, thus avoiding production delays. © 2024 by the authors.},

The structural health monitoring (SHM) of OWT support structures is a crucial aspect of operational maintenance for OWT support structures, aiming to mitigate significant financial losses. This paper systematically summarizes the current monitoring methods and technologies for OWT support structures, including towers and foundations. Through the review of monitoring content and the evolution of monitoring techniques for supporting structures, it delves deeper into the challenges faced by wind turbine monitoring and highlights potential avenues for future development. Then, the current damage identification techniques for OWT towers and foundations are analyzed, exploring various methods including model-based, vibration-based, artificial intelligence and hybrid fault diagnosis methods. The article also examines the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and outlines potential future directions for research and development in this field. Furthermore, it delves into the current damage identification techniques for OWT towers and foundations, discussing prevalent challenges and future directions in this domain.

	abstract = {A transition towards renewable energy and transport electrification requires a high demand for rare earth elements (REE). China's dominance in REE makes the supply chains vulnerable for REE-consuming countries. The UK is one of the only three major refining plants outside of China, and it has, therefore, an active role in the global REE supply chain. In addition, the UK recycling capacity of REE permanent magnets is in development. Understanding REE flows and stocks is required both for scaling up upstream refining capacity and for the recycling projects that are currently in commercial development. This study developed a material flow model of REE in NdFeB magnets used in electric vehicles and wind turbines, taking the UK (2017–2021) as a case. Results show that the UK is a net importer (1238 t of REE in REE compounds, 7787 t of REE in NdFeB magnets) and has a highly fragmented value chain. A significant amount of the REE remains in stocks, whilst most end-of-life REE-containing components were not recovered. Substantial data challenges cause a lack of traceability across the global REE supply chain. This needs to be addressed in order to enhance knowledge of how these REE are utilised. The proposed model and policy interventions can be applied to other countries to improve traceability and circularity. © 2024 The Authors},

An integrated monitoring system framework concept design for FWT is proposed combing the dynamic responses correlations of different structural parts and the deep learning technology, in which the intact and partial sensor failure operation modes are considered separately. The monitoring system consists of four vital structural components, including the rotor and nacelle, tower, floating foundation, and mooring system. In order to improve the tower response identification accuracy, a new method for the sensor optimization is proposed to utilize more structural information of the structure based on the effective independence method (EIM) and modal assurance criteria (MAC) methods. A multi-perception (MLP) neural network model based on the input-output coupling mechanism is established to identify the acceleration responses at the tower top and forces at tower root. The optimized identification model can greatly improve the identification accuracy of critical sensors by more than 50%, especially for bending moments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Rotating machinery has extensive usage in industrial applications, either as leading equipment (power plants) or as auxiliary equipment (oil and gas exploitation). These highly complex systems demand expensive maintenance programs due to the high costs of eventual shutdown. Consequently, critical fault diagnosis and prognosis are essential during the operation of those systems. Fault identification and classification demand robust verification of codes and calculations and a discerning validation of numerical models used for rotating machinery. Hence, verification and validation (V&V) are an essential initial service for a digital twin (DT), offering some advantages in this application. In this context, the following research question is proposed: Does V&V using DT improve data access and reduce the effort of data exchange? The following objectives are created to address the research question: perform a code verification, conduct the calculation verification, validate the models using two different validation approaches, and demonstrate easy access to asset data. For this study, two identical hydrodynamic bearings and a noncentral disk were considered, representing a laboratory experimental setup. The validation metric requirement is promisingly satisfied for the disk and bearings according to validation Approaches 1 and 2. Furthermore, validation Approach 2 generates even more successful results than approach 1. Accurate estimation and reliable interpretation of the numerical model outcomes encourage the application of DT for future fault diagnosis and prognosis. © 2024 by ASME.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to estimating short-term production of wind farms, which are made up of numerous turbine generators. It harnesses the power of big data through a blend of data-driven and model-based methods. Specifically, it combines an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for immediate future predictions of wind turbine power output with a stochastic model for dependability, using Hybrid Reliability Block Diagrams. A thorough state-of-the-art review has been conducted in order to demonstrate the applicability of an ANN for non-linear stochastic problems of energy or power forecast estimation. The study leverages an innovative cluster analysis to group wind turbines and reduce the computational effort of the ANN, with a dependability model that improves the accuracy of the data-driven output estimation. Therefore, the main novelty is the employment of a hybrid model that combines an ANN with a dependability stochastic model that accounts for the realistic operational scenarios of wind turbines, including their susceptibility to random shutdowns This approach marks a significant advancement in the field, introducing a methodology which can aid the design and the power production forecast. The research has been applied to a case study of a 24 MW wind farm located in the south of Italy, characterized by 28 turbines. The findings demonstrate that the integrated model significantly enhances short-term wind-energy production estimation, achieving a 480% improvement in accuracy over the solo-clustering approach. © 2024 by the authors.},

These scenarios can be an obstacle to sustainable or smart city developments. In a building which consists of various components, windows are the most influential to contribute to this energy consumption. To abate the excessive amount of building energy consumption, an alternative glazing system is paramount. Among the other available energy-efficient glazing, an active smart switchable is promising as it can be altered based on occupant choice. In this work, four active smart switchable glazings have been studied (electrochromic, suspended particle device, liquid crystal and gasochromic) based on their operating principle, glazing factors and energetic application. It is evident that EC has more material aspect investigation and overall energetic application for PLDC, SPD and EC needs more study. Gasochromic which can be a potential in future is not explored in higher order.

The DT method can completely cover the stress field distribution of the entire pressure-resistant shell and provide stress predictions for different sizes of deep-diving protection shells. The DT model has a three-level structure. The Level-1 DT maps the Finite Element Model to the digital model, which is verified by experiments. The difference between the experimental and numerical results is less than 9.4%. Then, the Level-2 DT deduces the digital model and expands the simulation database samples. The uncalculated stress field results in the simulation database could be obtained by the local Lagrangian interpolation method. Furthermore, the Level-3 DT can rapidly predict the stress field distribution in deep-diving spherical shell digital models. By comparison with different optimization algorithms, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm demonstrates strong optimization capabilities and fast convergence, and the error compared with the simulation results is less than 1%. Finally, combined with actual sensor measurements and historical experience data, this method can be used to carry out real-time mapping and synchronous deduction of the service state of the dynamic stress digital twin. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {As a sustainable replacement for fossil fuels, biodiesel is a game-changer in the energy sector. There is no strategy to minimize biodiesel's significance as a sustainable, clean fuel source in light of the increasing climate change and environmental sustainability concerns. Nevertheless, conventional biodiesel production methods often run into problems like inadequate conversion efficiency and inappropriate fuel properties, which impede their broad adoption. The revolutionary potential of nanotechnology to circumvent these limitations and revolutionize biodiesel consumption and production is explored in this review paper. There are new possibilities for improving biodiesel output and engine efficiency, thanks to nanotechnology, which can alter matter at the atomic and molecular levels. Using nano-catalysts, nano-emulsification processes, and nano-encapsulation procedures, researchers have made significant advances in improving biodiesel qualities such as stability, combustion efficiency, and viscosity. Through a comprehensive analysis of current literature and research data, this article elucidates the crucial role of nanotechnology in advancing biodiesel technology. By shedding light on the most current advancements, challenges, and potential future outcomes in nano-based biodiesel manufacturing and consumption, this review hopes to add to the growing corpus of knowledge in the field and inspire additional innovation.

	abstract = {Cavitation is a quasi-periodic process, and its non-stationarity leads to increasingly complex flow field structures. On the other hand, characterizing the flow field with greater precision has become increasingly feasible. However, accurately and effectively extracting the most representative vibration modes and spatial structures from these vast amounts of data has become a significant challenge. Researchers have proposed data-driven modal decomposition techniques to extract flow field information, which have been widely applied in various fields such as signal processing and fluid dynamics. This paper addresses the application of modal decomposition methods, such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD), in cavitation feature detection in hydraulic machinery. It reviews the mathematical principles of these three algorithms and a series of improvements made by researchers since their inception. It also provides examples of the applications of these three algorithms in different hydraulic machinery. Based on this, the future development trends and possible directions for the improvement of modal decomposition methods are discussed. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Pose estimation is crucial to guide a visual harvesting robot to detach crops. In this article, pose estimation for Sichuan peppers is formulated as an ordinal classification problem by defining several pose labels. The shared appearance between neighboring poses results in label ambiguity; meanwhile, there exist obvious variations in ambiguity degrees across images. Conventional one-hot label representations neglect the ambiguity, suffering from overfitting problems. Contrastly, label distribution learning (LDL) methods can handle the pose ambiguity by smoothing a single label to a label distribution. Recent adaptive LDL (ALDL) attempts to construct instance-aware label distributions adaptive to changing ambiguity degrees. However, we find that the existing ALDL methods inevitably underestimate the ambiguity variations in pepper poses. In this article, we devise an ambiguity measure relying on aleatoric uncertainty (AU) and subsequently propose a calibrated AU-based ALDL method for pepper pose estimation. specifically, we start from quantifying AU values for training samples using Bayesian neural networks, where the AU expresses the inherent observation noise. Then, the AU values are calibrated to expected risks heuristically learned on validation sets, preventing AU overestimating the ambiguity. Afterward, the risks act as the ambiguity measure to construct instance-aware label distributions for network training. Experiments on real pepper images show that our method sufficiently captures the ambiguity variations in pepper poses and obtains 88% mean accuracy, outperforming current ALDL methods. Additionally, our method provides reliable assessment on the quality of pose predictions. Both the obtained accuracy and prediction quality are of great practical value to nondestructive harvesting.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of industrial digitalization in the Industry 4.0 era is fundamentally transforming the industrial sector by connecting products, machines, and people, offering real-time digital models to allow self-diagnosis, self-optimization and self-configuration. However, this uptake in such a digital transformation faces numerous obstacles. For example, the lack of real-time data feeds to perform custom closed-loop control and realize common, powerful industrial systems, the complexity of traditional tools and their inability in finding effective solutions to industry problems, lack of capabilities to experiment rapidly on innovative ideas, and the absence of continuous real-time interactions between physical objects and their simulation representations along with reliable two-way communications, are key barriers towards the adoption of such a digital transformation. Digital twins hold the promise of improving maintainability and deployability, enabling flexibility, auditability, and responsiveness to changing conditions, allowing continuous learning, monitoring and actuation, and allowing easy integration of new technologies in order to deploy open, scalable and reliable Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). A critical understanding of this emerging paradigm is necessary to address the multiple dimensions of challenges in realizing digital twins at scale and create new means to generate knowledge in the industrial IoT. To address these requirements, this paper surveys existing digital twin along software technologies, standardization efforts and the wide range of recent and state-of-the-art digital twin-based projects; presents diverse use cases that can benefit from this emerging technology; followed by an in-depth discussion of the major challenges in this area drawing upon the research status and key trends in Digital Twins. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Wind turbines (WT) are a clean renewable energy source that have gained popularity in recent years. Gearboxes are complex, expensive, and critical components of WT, which are subject to high maintenance costs and several stresses, including high loads and harsh environments, that can lead to failure with significant downtime and financial losses. This paper focuses on the development of a digital twin-based approach for the modelling and simulation of WT gearboxes with the aim to improve their design, diagnosis, operation, and maintenance by providing insights into their behavior under different operating conditions. Powerful commercial computer-aided design tools (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) software are embedded into a computationally efficient multi-objective optimization framework (modeFrontier) with the purpose of maximizing the power density, compactness, performance, and reliability of the WT gearbox. High-fidelity models are used to minimize the WT weight, volume, and maximum stresses and strains achieved without compromising its efficiency. The 3D CAD model of the WT gearbox is carried out using SolidWorks (version 2023 SP5.0), the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is used to obtain the stresses and strains, fields are modelled using Ansys Workbench (version 2024R1), while the multibody kinematic and dynamic system is analyzed using Adams Machinery (version 2023.3, Hexagon). The method has been successfully applied to different case studies to find the optimal design and analyze the performance of the WT gearboxes. The simulation results can be used to determine safety factors, predict fatigue life, identify potential failure modes, and extend service life and reliability, thereby ensuring proper operation over its lifetime and reducing maintenance costs. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The potential energy of compressed air represents a multi-application source of power. Historically employed to drive certain manufacturing or transportation systems, it became a source of vehicle propulsion in the late 19th century. During the second half of the 20th century, significant efforts were directed towards harnessing pressurized air for the storage of electrical energy. Today’s systems, which are based on storing the air at a high pressure, are usually recognized as compressed air energy storage (CAES) installations. This paper aims to provide an overview of different technologies that take advantage of the energy accumulated in the compressed air. Particular attention is paid to the CAES installations that are working as electrical energy storage systems (EESs). These systems, developed originally as large capacity (>100 MWe) and fuel-based installations, may soon become fully scalable, highly efficient, and fuel-free electrical energy storage systems. To present this opportunity, a thorough review encompassing previous and up-to-date advancements in their development was carried out. In particular, CAES concepts, such as diabatic (D-CAES), adiabatic (A-CAES), and isothermal (I-CAES), are described in detail. This review also provides the detailed characteristics of the crucial elements of these configurations, including compressors, expanders, air storage chambers, and thermal storage tanks. Knowledge of these components and their role allows us to understand the main challenges behind the further development of the mentioned CAES setups. Apart from the CAES systems that are designed as EES systems, this paper describes other prospective technologies that utilize the energy of pressurized air. Accordingly, compressed air cars and their key elements are explained in detail. Moreover, the technology renowned as wave-driven compressed air energy storage (W-CAES) is described as well, indicating that the utilization of pressurized air represents a viable option for converting ocean energy into electrical power. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Fatigue has become a major consideration factor in modern offshore wind farms as optimized design codes, and a lack of lifetime reserve has made continuous fatigue life monitoring become an operational concern. In this contribution, we discuss a data-driven methodology for farm-wide tower-transition piece fatigue load estimation. We specifically debate the employment of this methodology in a real-world farm-wide setting and the implications of continuous monitoring. With reliable nacelle-installed accelerometer data at all locations, along with the customary 10-min supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) statistics and three strain gauge-instrumented 'fleet-leaders', we discuss the value of two distinct approaches: use of either fleet-leader or population-based data for training a physics-guided neural network model with a built-in conservative bias, with the latter taking precedence. In the context of continuous monitoring, we touch on the importance of data imputation, working under the assumption that if data are missing, then its fatigue loads should be modeled as under idling. With this knowledge at hand, we analyzed the errors of the trained model over a period of 9 months, with monthly accumulated errors always kept below (Formula presented.). A particular focus was given to performance under high loads, where higher errors were found. The cause for this error was identified as being inherent to the use of 10-min statistics, but mitigation strategies have been identified. Finally, the farm-wide results are presented on fatigue load estimation, which allowed to identify outliers, whose behavior we correlated with the operational conditions. Finally, the continuous data-driven, population-based approach here presented can serve as a springboard for further lifetime-based decision-making. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {The complex environmental impact makes it difficult to predict wind speed with high precision for multiple wind turbines. Most existing research methods model the temporal dependence of wind speeds, ignoring the spatial correlation between wind turbines. In this paper, we propose a multi-wind turbine wind speed prediction model based on Weighted Diffusion Graph Convolution and Gated Attention Network (WDGCGAN). To address the strong nonlinear correlation problem among multiple wind turbines, we use the maximal information coefficient (MIC) method to calculate the correlation weights between wind turbines and construct a weighted graph for multiple wind turbines. Next, by applying Diffusion Graph Convolution (DGC) transformation to the weight matrix of the weighted graph, we obtain the spatial graph diffusion matrix of the wind farm to aggregate the high-order neighborhood information of the graph nodes. Finally, by combining the DGC with the gated attention recurrent unit (GAU), we establish a spatio-temporal model for multi-turbine wind speed prediction. Experiments on the wind farm data in Massachusetts show that the proposed method can effectively aggregate the spatio-temporal information of wind turbine nodes and improve the prediction accuracy of multiple wind speeds. In the 1h prediction task, the average RMSE of the proposed model is 28% and 33.1% lower than that of the Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), respectively. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Wind turbines (WTs) have highly nonlinear and uncertain dynamics due to aerodynamic complexity, mechanical factors, and fluctuations in wind conditions. Turbulence and wind shear add complexity to modelling, especially in constant power region (region 3). Thus, an effective control design demands a deep understanding of the nonlinearities and uncertainties. This paper suggests a novel model-free reinforcement learning (RL) collective pitch angle controller to operate efficiently in region 3. The proposed controller stabilizes generator speed, maximizes power output, and minimizes fluctuations while accommodating system uncertainties, nonlinearity, and pitch limits. The disparity between WT dynamics due to wind speed perturbations and uncertainties is measured using a gap-metric criterion. The controller design adopts a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to train six agents in a medium-fidelity WT environment at different mean wind speeds to ensure the controller's robustness. Initially, imitation learning is used for efficient sample collection to fasten training convergence. Afterwards, the agent learns by interacting with the environment. After the training, the pitch control outputs from multi-trained agents are processed by a fuzzy system to have smooth transitions under different operating conditions. The resulting fuzzy DDPG (F-DDPG) controller is deployed to obtain the optimal pitch control action. The performance of the proposed F-DDPG controller is compared to the gain-scheduled PI (GSPI), Linear-Quadratic-Regulator (LQR), and single-DDPG-agent controllers. The controllers are simulated in high-fidelity onshore and offshore 5-MW WT environments using the OpenFAST/MATLAB simulation tools. The results reveal the superiority of the proposed controller in generalizing its optimal performance in different operating conditions. © 2024 ISA},

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used to simulate these cases and evaluate moment, angular velocity and power. Experimental validation was carried out in a wind tunnel that was designed and optimized with the support of CFD. The rotors for all three cases were 3D printed in resin to analyze their experimental performance as a function of wind speed. The moment and Maximum Power Point (MPP) were determined in each case. The simulation results indicate that the cycloid-type rotor outperforms the semicircular or S-type rotor by 15%. Additionally, experimental evidence confirms that the cycloid-type rotor performs better in all three cases.

	abstract = {Of late, the exponential rise in the global population is driving higher energy demand. However, the rapid depletion of conventional fossil fuels and growing environmental concerns have prompted the evolution of alternative energy sources. To this end, Microgrid (MG) with Renewable Energy Sources (RES) has emerged as popular means of small-scale localized power grid. However, planning of MG operation poses challenges due to the inherent variability and stochasticity in RES power output and energy demand. On account of this, the present study introduces a Stochastic Energy Management Strategy (SEMS) for a grid-connected MG incorporating Micro-Turbine, Fuel-Cell, RES, Battery Energy Storage, and electrical and heat energy demand. The stochasticity of RES is forecasted through a hybrid prediction model (sARIMA-GRU) and the uncertain demand is estimated via 'Monte Carlo Simulation.' The proposed problem is formulated as a dynamic non-linear stochastic optimization problem. It seeks to minimize the expected value of MG operational cost satisfying the practical constraints. Addressing this, a newly developed ‘Artificial Electric Field Algorithm (AEFA)' is utilized. Several case studies are performed to assess MG operation under varied operating conditions. Moreover, the present study analyses the impact of uncertainty on energy contribution from DER, grid dependency, and MG operation cost. Comparative analysis reveals that sARIMA-GRU outperforms other contemporary prediction models. It is noteworthy that the superior prediction accuracy of sARIMA-GRU leads to lower MG operation costs. Moreover, statistical analysis and convergence confirm the proficiency of applied AEFA over state-of-the-art Grey Wolf Optimization and Firefly Algorithm in solving the proposed problem. © 2024 The Author(s)},

This paper aims to construct a real-time semi-physical co-simulation of Variable-Speed-Variable-Pitch Wind Turbines (VSVP-WTs) equipped with a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). As for the deployment configuration, software such as OpenFAST and LabVIEW are used for system modeling, while the hardware, mainly NI devices, is adopted for real-time operation and strategy implementation. The physical behaviors of energy conversion are discussed separately, especially on aeroelastic dynamics and electronic power switching. Additionally, operational strategy for the whole production is established through an embedded industrial controller, which also serves as a bi-directional interaction path. An Ethernet network-based communication interface is constructed as an information channel in which a discrete model is extracted and discussed. The synchronization and stability among hardware are guaranteed with a proper period. Several cases demonstrate detailed dynamics of the whole WT, brought on by command adjustment, environmental factors, and power system faults.

	abstract = {Torque fluctuations in drivetrains are the result of dynamic excitations and can be unfavorable for the lifetime of the system. Passive ripple suppression methods exist, such as torsional dampers and flywheels, which are often bulky and not always desired. Alternatively, performant active control methods exist; however, their applicability to certain drivetrains is not covered. Therefore, this paper focuses on active control from a mechanical perspective, more specifically, drivetrain dynamics impacting active control effectiveness. A quasi-resonant controller is implemented as an active control method, and its performance and robustness are proven both in simulation on a 3-DOF mechanical model and experimentally at different excitation frequencies. The tests show that active control effectiveness is highly drivetrain-dependent. In particular, the propagation of the torque oscillation is influenced by the elastic filtering properties of the drivetrain, and the speed ripple depends on the inertial attenuation of the drivetrain. High-stiffness, low-inertia drivetrains benefit best from active control for ripple suppression because the inertial attenuation is limited, while high-stiffness elements increase the mechanical bandwidth before dynamic decoupling happens between the inertias of interest.

	abstract = {Evidence points to increasing the development of floating wind turbines to unlock the full potential of worldwide wind-energy generation. Barge-type floating wind turbines are of interest because of their shallow draft, structural simplicity, and moonpool-damping effect. Based on the BEM potential flow method, this study uses ANSYS-AQWA software to create a floating-barge moonpool platform model equipped with an OC5 NREL 5 MW wind turbine, to study the effect of the damping lid method on the resonance of the moonpool gap water, the wind–wave coupling effect, and the dynamic response of the FOWT and mooring system after single-line and double-line failure. The results show that the damping lid method, based on the potential flow theory, can effectively correct the effect caused by the lack of viscosity; the effect of a single breakage of upwind mooring lines on the motion is mainly in the sway and yaw modes, and after mooring line 8 breaks, the maximum tension of the adjacent mooring line increases by 2.91 times compared to the intact condition, which is 58.9% of the minimum breaking strength; and the breakage of two mooring lines located at one corner leads to a surge drift of up to 436.7 m and a cascading failure phenomenon. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven fault diagnosis methods are crucial for ensuring rotating machinery's safety and effective operation. The success of most current methods relies on the assumption that sufficient high-quality labeled datasets can be obtained for model training. However, in real-world industrial scenarios, obtaining such datasets is difficult or nearly impossible, thereby hindering the practical implementation of these methods. The integration of virtual modeling and transfer learning offers a powerful approach to meet the above challenge. Abundant virtual data of different fault categories can be acquired in the virtual space with highly flexible and at a low cost, and transfer learning can enhance the practical utility of these virtual data for contributing to the construction of diagnosis models. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twin-driven partial domain fault diagnosis method based on unlabeled physical data and labeled virtual data. First, a virtual model of rotating machinery is built to generate labeled virtual fault data with enough fault types. Then, an adversarial transfer learning network is developed to leverage the effective knowledge from the virtual and physical data. Meanwhile, a weighting learning module is introduced to reduce the negative effect caused by the redundant fault categories in the virtual space. Finally, the proposed digital twin-driven transfer learning network is trained with the labeled virtual data and unlabeled physical data. Experiments on a light truck transmission system demonstrate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory diagnostic performance even without labeled physical fault data, contributing to the advancement of AI engineering applications. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

The magnitude and extent of the cyclic loading can create a fatigue limit state controlling the design of support structures. In this paper, the remaining fatigue life of the support structure for a GE Haliade 6 MW fixed-bottom jacket offshore wind turbine within the Block Island Wind Farm (BIWF) is assessed. The fatigue damage to the tower and the jacket support structure using stress time histories at instrumented and non-instrumented locations are processed. Two validated finite-element models are utilized for assessing the stress cycles. The modal expansion method and a simplified approach using static calculations of the responses are employed to estimate the stress at the non-instrumented locations—known as virtual sensors. It is found that the hotspots at the base of the tower have longer service lives than the jacket. The fatigue damage to the jacket leg joints is less than 20% and 40% of its fatigue capacity during the 25-year design lifetime of the BIWF OWT, using the modal expansion method and the simplified static approach, respectively. © 2024 by the authors.},

This article introduces the development history and current status of offshore floating wind power in foreign and domestic countries, elaborates in detail on the development path of floating wind power from prototype demonstration, small-scale floating wind farms to large-scale commercial development, and analyzes the basic concepts and characteristics of different floating wind power systems. Technical challenges faced by the localization development of China's floating wind power were analyzed, mainly including: large capacity floating wind turbines, low-cost floating wind power foundation platforms, domestic development of new mooring systems, development of dynamic cable systems, efficient construction and installation modes, and intelligent operation and maintenance safety guarantees. In response to China's unique marine environment, port and terminal conditions, and wind power industry chain, research directions and development suggestions for offshore floating wind power were proposed: studying and designing large capacity floating wind power suitable for China's deep-sea anti typhoon type to break through the bottleneck of cost reduction and parity development of floating wind power; considering efficient and intensive sea use layout to develop floating wind farms on a large scale; strengthening the complete supply chain of the floating wind power industry to promote the localization process of core components and equipment; innovating the new model and path of "offshore wind power+", and exploring the complementary and integrated development of offshore wind power and oil and gas fields.

	abstract = {Holo-Hilbert spectral analysis (HHSA) has been demonstrated to be an effective instantaneous feature demodulation tool for revealing the coupling relationship between the frequency-modulated (FM) carriers and amplitude-modulated (AM) characteristics within nonlinear and non-stationary mechanical vibration signals. However, it is unable to acquire the time varying AM characteristics from the vibration signals of the equipment operates under variable speed conditions. To decode such signals, inspired by HHSA, a novel angle-time double-layer decomposition structure termed order-frequency HHSA (OFHHSA) is established to demodulate the fault information from the time varying vibration signals in this paper. The corresponding spectrogram, namely, order-frequency Holo-Hilbert spectrum (OFHHS) is acquired for describing the interaction relationship between time and angle domains. Besides, the order AM-marginal spectrum is derived from the OFHHS via integrating the carrier variable to exhibit the fault characteristic-related orders. Moreover, the differences between OFHHSA and angle-time cyclo-stationary framework-based order-frequency spectral correlation (OFSC) are analyzed for time varying machinery fault diagnosis. Finally, from the analyses of simulated and tested data of mechanical equipment, the OFHHSA method has avoided the limitations of the two OFSC estimators on periodic assumption and the maximum cut-off order, and the proposed method obtained a more accurate rate in fault identification and more robust ability of anti-noise. © 2024 ISA},

With advancements in structural health monitoring (SHM) methods and implementations, DT-based maintenance and operation stages have been implemented significantly during the life cycle of civil infrastructure.

This paper undertakes a systematic literature review of studies on DT-related applications for SHM of civil structures. It classifies the articles based on thematic case studies: transportation infrastructure (i.e. bridges, tunnels, roads, and pavements), buildings, off-shore marine infrastructure and wind turbines, and other civil engineering systems. The proposed review is further uniquely sub-classified using diverse modeling approaches such as building information modeling, finite element modeling, 3D representation, and surrogate and hybrid modeling used in DT implementations. This paper is solely focused on applications relating DTs to SHM practices for various civil engineering infrastructures, hence highlighting its novelty over previous reviews.

When the wind speed exceeds its rated value, the pitch angle controller limits the generator output power to its rated value. In this research work, several soft computing techniques have been implemented for pitch control of variable-speed wind turbine. The data is collected for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory offshore 5 MW baseline wind turbine. Wind speed, tip speed ratio, and power coefficient are taken as inputs, and pitch angle as output. Machine learning and artificial intelligence-based techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), multilayer perceptron feed-forward neural network (MLPFFNN), and fuzzy logic controller (FLC) are implemented on MATLAB, and their results are evaluated in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE). The controllers have been implemented in MATLAB/Simulink to schedule the wind turbine blade pitch angle and keep the output power stable at the rated value. The experimental results show that RNN provided the best results for 15 neurons in hidden layers and 1000 epochs with MSE of 3.28e-11 and RMSE of 5.54e-06, followed by MLPFFNN with MSE of 2.17e-10 and RMSE of 1.56e-05, ANFIS with MSE of 8.5e-05 and RMSE of 9.22e-03, and FLC with MSE of 6.25e-04 and RMSE of 0.025. The proposed scheme is more reliable and robust and can be easily implemented on a physical setup by using interfacing cards such as dSPACE, NI cards, and data acquisition cards. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {This study uses a wind turbine case study as a subdomain of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to showcase an architecture for implementing a distributed digital twin in which all important aspects of a predictive maintenance solution in a DT use a fog computing paradigm, and the typical predictive maintenance DT is improved to offer better asset utilization and management through real-time condition monitoring, predictive analytics, and health management of selected components of wind turbines in a wind farm. Digital twin (DT) is a technology that sits at the intersection of Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, and Software Engineering to provide a suitable tool for replicating physical objects in the digital space. This can facilitate the implementation of asset management in manufacturing systems through predictive maintenance solutions leveraged by machine learning (ML). With DTs, a solution architecture can easily use data and software to implement asset management solutions such as condition monitoring and predictive maintenance using acquired sensor data from physical objects and computing capabilities in the digital space. While DT offers a good solution, it is an emerging technology that could be improved with better standards, architectural framework, and implementation methodologies. Researchers in both academia and industry have showcased DT implementations with different levels of success. However, DTs remain limited in standards and architectures that offer efficient predictive maintenance solutions with real-time sensor data and intelligent DT capabilities. An appropriate feedback mechanism is also needed to improve asset management operations. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The development of digital twins for wind farms often involves the use of large-eddy simulation (LES) to model atmospheric boundary layers. Existing LES solvers primarily focus on accurately capturing streamwise fluctuations. They, however, overlook the less energetic cross-stream fluctuations, which play a crucial role in wind turbine wake evolution. In this study, we conduct a systematic parametric study and incorporate changes in an open-source LES solver. The improved solver is able to predict all three components of velocity fluctuations in alignment with the scaling laws derived from the attached-eddy hypothesis. In particular, we examine the impact of (i) the subgrid-scale model, (ii) the wall model, (iii) the von Kármán constant, and (iv) the grid-cell aspect ratio. We find that although all these factors influence the prediction of velocity fluctuations, the grid-cell aspect ratio has the greatest effect on the spanwise and vertical velocity components. Notably, utilizing nearly isotropic grid cells leads to the best alignment of all three velocity component fluctuations with the scaling laws. Spectral analysis further demonstrates that the present LES solver accurately predicts the characteristic length scales for all velocity fluctuation components, making it a reliable tool for obtaining turbulent inflow conditions for wind farm modeling. © 2024 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Wind turbines play a pivotal role in contemporary renewable energy systems, necessitating precise monitoring and fault identification to ensure their optimal performance and longevity. In existing data-driven approaches for wind turbine condition monitoring, the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system has been commonly utilized for analysis; however, these methods often overlook the intricate interactions among wind turbine components and the precise fault location. And the regression-like neural network models used make it difficult to learn abstract representations from the data, even though the deep architectures show promise in learning hierarchical features, they may have difficulty effectively untangle and capture intricate underlying factors. In this paper a novel wind turbines condition monitoring and fault identification methodology is proposed based on a diffusion model and multi-parameter information fusion. To begin, a conditional stochastic process diffusion (CSPD) model is proposed, leveraging conditional parameters to discern the data distribution characteristics of target parameters through stochastic process diffusion, forming the foundational basis for subsequent condition monitoring analysis. Subsequently, the magnitude of the difference between the true and generated values of each target parameter is expressed by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. So, anomaly evaluation indicator (AAI) based on the multivariate coefficient of variation (MCV) computed from KL divergence is formulated. The indicator amalgamates information from multiple parameters, enabling comprehensive and precise monitoring of wind turbine operational states. Lastly, an anomaly decomposition method founded on MCV is proposed, aiding in the assessment of the abnormal contribution of each parameter and the precise fault localization. Through analysis of SCADA datasets from two real wind farms, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methodology are demonstrated. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

To better understand the potential impacts of future climate change on lake thermal dynamics and related processes, the use of mathematical models is essential. In this study, we provide a comprehensive review of lake water temperature modeling. We begin by discussing the physical concepts that regulate thermal dynamics in lakes, which serve as a primer for the description of process-based models. We then provide an overview of different sources of observational water temperature data, including in situ monitoring and satellite Earth observations, used in the field of lake water temperature modeling. We classify and review the various lake water temperature models available, and then discuss model performance, including commonly used performance metrics and optimization methods. Finally, we analyze emerging modeling approaches, including forecasting, digital twins, combining process-based modeling with deep learning, evaluating structural model differences through ensemble modeling, adapted water management, and coupling of climate and lake models.
